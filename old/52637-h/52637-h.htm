<p class="chaptitle">SOMETHING NEW IN NAVAL LIFE.</p>


<p>One breezy day in early June, when a fresh
wind off shore was whipping the water into
sparkling white caps, excitement and comment
fairly hummed about the crowded foredecks of
the big Dreadnought <i>Manhattan</i>.</p>

<p>The formidable looking sea-fighter lay with
half a dozen other smaller naval vessels&mdash;battleships
and cruisers&mdash;in the stretch of water known
as Hampton Roads, which, sheltered by rising
ground, has, from time immemorial, formed an
anchorage for our fighting-ships, and is as rich
in historical associations as any strip of sea
within the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The cause of all the turmoil, which was agitating
every jackie on the vessel, was a notice
which had been posted on the ship's bulletin
board that morning.</p>

<p>It was tacked up in the midst of notices of
band concerts, challenges to boxing matches, lost
or found articles, and the like. At first it had
not attracted much attention. But soon one
jackie, and then another, had scanned it till, by
means of the thought-wireless, which prevails
on a man-of-war, the whole fore part of the
ship was now vibrant and buzzing with the intelligence.</p>

<p>The notice which had excited so much attention
read as follows:</p>

<p>"Enlisted Men and Petty Officers: You are
instructed to send your volunteer applications for
positions in the experimental Aero squad. All
applications to be made in writing to Lieutenant
De Frees in charge of the experiment station."</p>

<p>"Aero service, eh?" grunted more than one
grizzled old shell-back, "well, I've served my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
time in many an old sea-going hooker, but hanged
if I'd venture my precious skin on board a sky-clipper."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, mate. Let the youngsters risk their
lily-white necks if they want to," formed the
burden of the growled responses, "but you and
me 'ull smoke Uncle Sam's baccy, and take our
pay with a good deck under our feet."</p>

<p>But this state of caution did not extend to the
younger members of the ship's company. Least
of all to Boatswain's Mate Herc&mdash;otherwise Hercules&mdash;Taylor
and his inseparable chum, Ned
Strong, the latter of whom was now chief gunner's
mate of the biggest vessel in the navy.</p>

<p>Neither Ned nor Herc smoked. By observation
of those who did indulge in the practice,
they had discovered that the use of tobacco affected
more senses than one, and rendered a
man incapable of the highest physical proficiency.
The custom of smoking not only impaired the
eyesight of many a gunner, but in the athletic
sports, of which both lads were so fond, it also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
showed its bad effects. Ned knew of more than
one promising young gun-pointer who had been
compelled to relinquish his laurels on account of
tobacco-affected eyesight.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the two trim, clean-cut lads,
their faces bronzed and clear from sea air and
clean living, stood apart from the group about
the "smoke-lamp."</p>

<p>"I'm going to send in my name," announced
Ned with twinkling eyes. "The aero section of
the navy is going to be an important one in the
future. There is a good chance for a chap to
advance himself in such work."</p>

<p>"By the great horn spoon!" muttered Herc,
in his enthusiastic, whimsical way, "I'm with
you, Ned. We'll be regular sky-pilots before
the summer's out!"</p>

<p>He began to rub his shoulder-blades, while a
humorous smile played over his freckled, straightforward
features.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Ned, noting Herc's
brisk rubbing of the part aforesaid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, hum! I thought I felt my wings sprouting,"
replied Herc, with a broad grin.</p>

<p>"Tell you what, we've a few minutes yet. Let's
get our ditty boxes&mdash;or 'ditto' boxes, as you used
to call them&mdash;and write our applications at once."</p>

<p>"Let's talk a while longer," said Herc, with
an odd look.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter? Surely you aren't
regretting your determination already."</p>

<p>Herc, for reply, bent over and touched his
feet.</p>

<p>"No; they're not cold," he said; "I thought for
a minute they were." Then he looked up into
the cloudless blue vault of the heavens.</p>

<p>"Say, Ned, it's an awful long way up there,
isn't it? How far, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"What do you want to know for?" asked Ned,
moving away.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. Only I'd like to know how far
we are likely to tumble, in case we get our applications
accepted, and in case we fly as high as
the sky, and in case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, come on, Herc," urged Ned; "time enough
to worry about that when we are assigned to
aero duty."</p>

<p>"All that goes up must come down," said
Herc sagely, joining Ned nevertheless, "but we've
reversed the process."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?"</p>

<p>"Well, when we were on submarine duty we
explored the bottom of the sea, didn't we? And
now, if all goes well, we're going to venture
aloft."</p>

<p>Ned burst into a laugh, and they moved off
arm in arm, exchanging greetings with the
crowd of blue jackets lounging about at the after-dinner
rest. As they threaded their way among
them, Herc burst into song:</p>

<p>"'There's a sweet little cherub that sits up
aloft!' That's me, Ned."</p>

<p>"First freckled cherub I ever heard of,"
chuckled Ned.</p>

<p>Leaving the two lads to write their letters, we
feel that it is now our duty to let our readers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
know something more about Ned Strong and
Herc Taylor. They are two lads worth knowing.
Neither of them much over eighteen years of
age, they had, during their short career in the
navy, each made his mark in no uncertain fashion.
In his chosen branch of the service, Ned
Strong was admired by the officers and adored
by the men. His advance had been rapid, and
some of his more enthusiastic friends were already
hinting at a commission in sight for him in
the time to come.</p>

<p>As for the merry, light-hearted Herc Taylor,
that befreckled youth had as many friends among
officers and men as Ned, and was one of the
youngest bos'un's mates in the navy.</p>

<p>As readers of the Dreadnought Boys series
know, both lads had entered the navy, like so
many other "likely" recruits, from a farm. From
the first a measure of luck had been theirs. But
dogged perseverance, and a determination to
overcome all obstacles by honorable means, had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
also, aided them not a little in their rapid advance.</p>

<p>In "<i>The Dreadnought Boys on Battle Practice</i>,"
we followed the early steps of their life in
the navy. It was not all as pleasant as they had
imagined it would be. To the boys, as "rookies,"
much hard, and not over-pleasant work, fell.
But scrubbing decks, cleaning paint and the like,
they accepted in good part. "It's helping to keep
our $5,000,000 home trim and fit," was the way
Ned used to put it.</p>

<p>A ship's bully tried his best to make their
paths thorny, but Ned, in a battle that will live
long in forecastle annals, bested him. Kennell
tried to take a despicable revenge. With a
gang of rascals, he concerned himself in a plot
to injure the Dreadnought Boys. But his machinations
came to naught. Instead, Ned became
the means of saving the inventor of a new explosive
and type of gun from a serious predicament.
Right after this, Herc's turn came, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
he displayed wonderful heroism following a disastrous
"flare-back."</p>

<p>Following the stirring days at Guantanamo,
came a voyage on a torpedo-boat destroyer, the
celebrated <i>Beale</i>. The two lads, on this cruise,
found themselves plunged into the very thick of
a South American revolution. The uprising seriously
affected American interests, and, by a
stroke of good fortune, our lads were able to
play a prominent part in bringing the situation to
a successful outcome. In this book one of the
many exciting adventures described was the lads'
escape from a prison, when it was shelled during
a hot engagement, and their subsequent daredevil
dash on board a revolutionary torpedo craft.</p>

<p>By this time, although, of course, their participation
in the revolution could not be "mentioned
in the despatches," the boys had placed themselves
in line for promotion. The eyes of their
superiors were on them. But success did not
spoil them or "swell their heads." They were
still just as ready to fulfill an order promptly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
cheerfully as in their apprentice days. As that
is the spirit that wins in the navy, the Dreadnought
Boys were singled out for some hazardous
work on board a new type of submarine.
Enemies of Uncle Sam nearly succeeded in sinking
the diving boat for good and all with an infernal
machine, but the boys providentially discovered
the plot in time, and saved many lives.
In that book, too, they had an interesting encounter
with Sound pirates, and played a rather
prominent part in the pretty romance of the diving
boat's inventor.</p>

<p>The opening of this book finds them back on
regular duty. Although the routine of battleship
life in times of peace may seem tame and
humdrum, the boys, nevertheless, devoted themselves
to it with the same cheerful zest which
had carried them through so many dashing adventures.</p>

<p>But the quiet and monotonous daily existence
which they had enjoyed during and since the
winter cruise to European stations, was not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
last long. Although they did not know it, the
Dreadnought Boys were on the brink of some
most remarkable happenings.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Herc, as, their letters written
and deposited in the ship's post-office, the
two chums emerged on deck once more, "you
haven't let this aerial business drive the recollection
of to-morrow's races out of your mind,
have you?"</p>

<p>He referred to some contests ashore, which
had been arranged with enthusiasm by the officers
and crews of the ships of the squadron.</p>

<p>"I should say not," laughed Ned. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, only there are a few chaps in the
fleet who'd like to see us both fall down hard.
You're in good trim, Ned?"</p>

<p>"I think so. Feel fit, anyway."</p>

<p>"I needn't have asked you. I know you're
always in good shape."</p>

<p>"I can return the compliment," laughed Ned.</p>

<p>Just then the bugles began singing the calls
for the busy afternoon's practice-work on guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and at drill. With a hasty word, the chums
separated and hurried to take their places in
the big machine of which they were already important
cogs.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"IF HE'S A MAN, HE'LL STAND UP."</p>


<p>The passage of Ned and Herc from the foredeck
in quest of their ditty-boxes had not gone
unnoted by two men lounging at ease under the
shadow of the great 13-inch guns projecting
from the forward turret. The big circular steel
structure acted as a wind-break, and the pair lay
here smoking and talking in low tones.</p>

<p>"I'd give fifty dollars to know Ned Strong's
secret," observed one of them, flicking the ashes
from a cigar upon the spotless decks, a deliberate
infraction of the ship's laws. Selden Merritt
was one of the few "before the mast" men on
board who smoked cigars. A pipe and a plug
of black, rank tobacco usually does for your
jackie, but Merritt was an exception to the
rule.</p>

<p>"It would be worth it," agreed his companion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
a heavily-set chap of about nineteen. His cap
was off, and his black, bristly hair, cut pompadour,
stood straight up from his rather low forehead.</p>

<p>Merritt was a man of about twenty-four,
blonde, thin and "race-horsey" in build. He
had the reputation of having been a college man
and champion runner, until, losing prestige and
reputation through dissipation, he had been forced
to enlist. It had proved the best thing he ever
did. Four years in the navy had given him a
pink, clear skin, a bright eye and an erect carriage.
But it had not taken a furtive sneer out
of his expression, nor altered his disposition,
which was mean and crafty. His bearing, however,
was rather distinguished, with a certain
swagger, and his talk showed that he was an
educated man.</p>

<p>"Did you have much to do with them on their
first cruise?" inquired Merritt's companion, Ray
Chance.</p>

<p>"No, they were both enlisted men. But they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
managed to give a black eye, in a figurative way,
to a good friend of mine."</p>

<p>"You mean Bill Kennell?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I hear that he's been pardoned from
prison&mdash;political pull. But that doesn't alter the
fact that they accomplished his downfall."</p>

<p>"Well, I never liked either of them. I heard
about them by reputation before I came to the
<i>Manhattan</i> from the <i>Dixie</i>. I like them still less
from what I've seen of them on board here. I
think this fellow Strong is a big faker."</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm sick and disgusted with him and
the airs he gives himself. His dear chum and
inseparable is almost as bad. I'd like to take a
fall out of both of them."</p>

<p>"You'll get your chance to-morrow in the
squadron's games. You can beat Ned Strong
running the best day he ever stepped on a track."</p>

<p>"I ought to be able to, and I mean to do it,
too. I don't like bluffs, and this chap Strong is
a false alarm if ever there was one."</p>

<p>"Say, you fellows," suddenly interpolated a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
voice, "if you think Strong is such a bluff, why
don't you tell him so?"</p>

<p>The interruption came from a short, stocky,
little blue-jacket, lounging nearby. He had been
reading a book on gunnery, but the raised voices
of the Dreadnought Boy's detractors had aroused
his attention. His blue eyes twinkled rather
humorously, as he eyed the agile, long-limbed
Merritt and his sallow, dark-haired companion.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Benjamin Franklin; were you rubbering
on our conversation?" said Merritt, assuming
an indignant expression.</p>

<p>"Ben Franklin" was the nickname given to the
studious tar whose right name was Stephen
Wynn.</p>

<p>"It didn't take any 'rubbering,' as you call it,
to overhear you," said Wynn quietly; "if you
take my advice, when you want to say mean
things about Ned Strong or his chum, you'll
lower your voice aboard this ship. They've got
quite a few friends."</p>

<p>"Just the same," maintained Merritt, "the chap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
isn't all he sets up to be. He's got some secret,
like all such fellows."</p>

<p>"I guess his secret is hard work and attention
to duty," said Wynn rather shortly, returning to
his reading.</p>

<p>"You don't seriously think that there is any
chance of Strong's giving you a tussle for the
first place?" asked Ray Chance.</p>

<p>"Frankly, I don't. But there is always a possibility
of mistaking one's man. I'm wise enough
to know that."</p>

<p>"But you have arranged in some way to make
success certain?"</p>

<p>Merritt gave Chance a quizzical look.</p>

<p>"You know me," he said, with a knowing wink,
"Chalmers of the old <i>Luzzy</i> (sailor slang for
the <i>Louisiana</i>) is an old friend of mine. He dislikes
Strong as much as I do. He's the next best
man in the race. If things go wrong, we've got
a little system arranged to pocket friend Strong.
But how about you? You are pitted against
Taylor in the pole vault, aren't you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and I ain't worrying, you bet."</p>

<p>Merritt still retained a good choice of diction,
a relic of his college days, but Chance's talk was
was more uncouth and less polished.</p>

<p>"Good! I don't mind telling you I've got
some money out on myself. Enough to swamp
a good deal of my pay, in fact. I've got to win."</p>

<p>"About the same thing here," grinned Chance;
"if I lose, it's all up with me financially. I'm in
pretty deep."</p>

<p>"Tell you what," said Merritt suddenly, "I
hear that there will be extra pay and bonuses
attaching to this aero duty. Let's send in applications,
and then if we get trimmed in the races
and jumps we will have a chance to get some
extra coin."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," agreed Chance. But
as they started to carry out their intention, the
same bugle calls that had hastened the steps of
Ned and Herc recalled them to duty.</p>

<p>Stephen Wynn arose with a sigh, and thrust
his book inside his loose blouse. "Ben Franklin"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
disliked to leave his studies for duty. But he
was a smart sailor, and formed one of Ned's
gun crew. Merritt and Chance were on one of
the after turrets.</p>

<p>"Those fellows took care to sink their voices
after they found out I'd overheard them," said
Wynn to himself, as he fell in with the rest of
the blue-jackets. "I'll bet that they were plotting
some mischief to Strong and Taylor. At
any rate, I'll put them on their guard at the first
opportunity I get."</p>

<p>At three-thirty, or seven bells, the gun drills
and calisthenic exercises were over, and a brief
space of leisure ensued. Wynn, according to his
determination, sought out Ned and Herc. He
lost no time in communicating his suspicions to
them. But, somewhat to his astonishment,
neither of the lads seemed much impressed.</p>

<p>"A fellow who plots and backbites in dark
corners is not one to be scared of," said Ned.
"But just the same, Ben Franklin, I'm obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
to you. I guess we'll keep our eyes on our two
friends, eh, Herc?"</p>

<p>"Not worth bothering with," observed Herc,
"as the car conductor said when the fellow offered
him a plugged dime. If they can win fair
and square, we won't grudge it to them."</p>

<p>"Well, I've warned you," said "Ben Franklin."
"By the way, what makes those fellows so sore
at you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Merritt, so I've heard, was a friend of
Bill Kennell. He was the fellow, you know, who
kidnapped Mr. Varian in Cuba. He naturally
dislikes us for the part we played in apprehending
Kennell. As for Chance, he was in my gun
crew up to a few weeks ago. I had to have him
up 'at the stick' for insubordination once or twice,
and I guess it's stuck in his craw."</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for you, Ned, he'd have
gone to the brig," put in Herc.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I thought that a taste of the brig
would be too severe," said Ned. "I hoped a good
wigging by the 'old man' (the captain) would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
sufficient, but it wasn't. Then Chance sulked and
played sick. He took in the doctor for a while,
but it didn't last. He was punished and restored
to duty with an after gun crew following that."</p>

<p>"And blames you for all his troubles," said
Herc indignantly, "and I guess I come in for
a share of his dislike."</p>

<p>"Oh, life's too short to worry about Merritt
and Chance," said Ned, breaking off the conversation.
"It looks as if we'd have a glorious day
to-morrow," he went on, adroitly turning the
topic of talk. The ruse succeeded. The three
shipmates fell to discussing the coming games.
Others joined them, and the time passed rapidly
till five-thirty,&mdash;three bells&mdash;when all hands
were piped to supper, a plain but substantial
meal. For the benefit of our non-seafaring
reader, we will tell him that on this particular
night it consisted of:&mdash;hot roast-beef hash, cold
boiled ham, canned peaches, bread, butter and tea
or coffee. Thus, it will be seen that Uncle Sam
does not starve his blue-jackets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Supper was in full swing when Ned, who was
at the head of the table which seated his "mess,"
was the recipient of a surprising testimonial.</p>

<p>It came in the shape of a hot baked potato,
flung with accuracy and speed. It struck the
Dreadnought Boy in the eye, and burst, spreading
its pasty contents over his features. Herc,
who sat by Ned, leaped to his feet in a flash,
while Ned hastily pawed the mass out of his
eyes.</p>

<p>"I saw who threw that," cried Herc, his face
aflame, the freckles looming up like spots on
the sun; "if he's a man, he'll stand up."</p>

<p>A stir ran through the forecastle. Herc's finger
pointed to a distant table and rested on the
form of Merritt. Chance sat by him. Both had
been laughing an instant before, but as Merritt
saw that he had been found out his face assumed
a rather sickly grin.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Herc," ordered Ned rather sternly,
"I'll attend to this. Am I to understand that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
threw that potato?" he demanded, fixing his gaze
straight on Merritt's face.</p>

<p>The other's eyes sank. He looked disturbed
and a bit scared. Ned's voice had held no uncertain
ring.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it was just a joke," he said. "You don't
need to get huffy about it."</p>

<p>"Rather a strenuous joke, wasn't it?" asked
Ned in a firm, calm voice, while the eyes of every
man in the place were fixed on him in breathless
attention.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't mean to hit you," went on Merritt.
"I just wanted to give you a jump. It was just
a joke&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"That being the case," resumed Ned, "I shall
have to ask you to remove the consequences of
your <i>joke</i>."</p>

<p>So saying, he deliberately threw the remains
of the potato on the deck.</p>

<p>"Now, come here and pick that up and carry
it back," he said, with a flash in his eyes. "We'll
carry this joke through to its conclusion."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Merritt turned pale and hesitated. Then he
caught Ned's eye. A certain glint in it seemed
to galvanize him into action. Amid a roar of
laughter from the entire assemblage, Merritt,
red and white by turns, crossed to Ned's table
and carefully picked up every scrap of the débris.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" he glared at
Herc, as he made his way back to his own place.</p>

<p>"At your joke," sputtered Herc, affecting a
spasm of amusement. "Ho! ho! ho! That's one
of the best jokes I've ever seen."</p>

<p>"It is, is it?" glowered Merritt.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it isn't as big a joke as it would have
been if you hadn't done as Ned told you. Ho!
ho! ho! It isn't every puppy that will fetch and
carry at the first lesson."</p>

<p>The shout of laughter was taken up by the rest
of the blue-jackets. Amid this storm of merriment,
Merritt made his way to his seat. He
reached it just as the officer of the deck entered.</p>

<p>"Merritt, what are you out of your place for?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
demanded this dignitary, who was noted as a
strict disciplinarian.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I dropped a potato, sir, and was picking
it up," stammered Merritt, trembling with rage
and mortification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">FOR THE TROPHY OF THE FLEET.</p>


<p>As Ned had prophesied, the next day was
bright and clear. There was just enough of the
coolness of early summer to give a crisp tang to
the air. It stirred the blood like martial music.
It was a day which challenged every athlete in
the squadron to do his best. That is, so far as
external conditions were concerned.</p>

<p>The ground selected for the trying out of the
championship of the squadron was a flat field,
some five acres in extent, not far from the shore.
It stood on slightly rising ground. Trees, fresh
and green, stood in a thick mass on one side.
Seaward the ground sloped gently, and beyond
could be seen the grim sea-fighters, swinging
at anchor; from some of the smoke-stacks vapor
curled lazily. The basket-like fighting masts resembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the work of some geometrically inclined
spider.</p>

<p>Cheering and laughing, the contingents from
the various ships were landed after dinner. In
their midst, guarding them jealously, as bees
would their queen, each ship's company surrounded
their group of athletes. And a fine
showing they made when they assembled in the
dressing-rooms under the grandstand. This
structure was already occupied by the officers of
the division, headed by Rear Admiral Cochran,
a white-haired veteran of the seven seas. A
sprinkling of ladies in bright costumes lent a
dash of color to the scene.</p>

<p>The course had been laid out, and the officers
who had constituted themselves a committee in
charge of the sports were already busy about
it, when the <i>Manhattan's</i> boats landed their
laughing, singing, cheering blue-jackets. Among
them were Ned and Herc. Neither of them had
yet changed to their running togs. Merritt and
Chance had, however, but they both wore long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
raincoats, which prevented Ned from sizing them
up, as he was anxious to do.</p>

<p>Both the Dreadnought Boys were quiet and
self-contained as usual. But Merritt and Chance
were talking loudly and flinging remarks right
and left. Atwell, Turner, Simpkins, Jessup and
a dozen other <i>Manhattan</i> entries in various
events formed the remainder of the athletic contingent
from the big dreadnought. As they
entered the dressing-rooms&mdash;or rather the big
space under the grandstand&mdash;a babel of cries
of welcome and jocular defiance surged about the
Manhattanites.</p>

<p>"Here come the champions of the squadron,"
shouted some one.</p>

<p>"Say, Jack, wait till they are champions before
you start giving the title to them," hailed
another voice. It was that of Chalmers of the
<i>Louisiana</i>. He wore dark-green running trunks
with a white shirt. Across his chest was a red,
white and blue sash, on which was blazoned the
name of his ship. Several of the other runners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and athletes affected this touch of dandyism.
Ned and Herc, however, wore plain running
suits: trunks and sleeveless shirts and good track
shoes.</p>

<p>Chalmers lost no time in seeking out Merritt.
The two conversed in a corner in low tones.
After a time, Ned and Herc, too, succeeded in
getting away from a crowd of their shipmates
and found time to pass a word or two.</p>

<p>Merritt had cast off his long coat to adjust his
trunks. Ned found his eyes riveted on the fellow.
If physique were any criterion, Merritt
should have been a fine runner.</p>

<p>Clean-cut as a race-horse, his skin was smooth
and of good color, with lithe muscles playing
under it. He was the beau ideal in build of a
speed machine. Chance, on the other hand, was
heavier-set, but he showed up well in that assemblage
of athletically built men and youths.
Both Ned and Herc agreed that the two whom
they instinctively regarded as enemies were by
no means to be rated lightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>But a sharp bugle call cut short further observation.
The games were beginning. The
hundred-yard dash was third on the program,
and Ned did not emerge till just before the starting
time. The wind was sharp, and he did not
want to contract his muscles by letting the cold
air blow on his limbs. Herc, in a heavy navy
coat, went to the starting line with him. He
stood by his chum, giving him some last words
of advice. Ned appeared to listen, but his
thoughts were actually elsewhere. He had already
made up his mind to his course of action.
He was going to run a waiting race, depending
on a sharp spurt to win.</p>

<p>In a quick glance over the six entrants, he saw
that Chalmers and Merritt were the only ones
he had cause to fear. He noticed them whispering
together, and resolved to keep a sharp lookout
on their actions.</p>

<p>The air was filled with shouts and suggestions
and greetings from blue-jackets, who were encouraging
the men from their own ship. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
man in the squadron who could be spared was
there. They made a big throng, lining the track
on the side away from the grandstand.</p>

<p>"Hey, there, Springer! Do your prettiest for
the <i>Merrimac</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, you Polthew! Don't forget the <i>Massachusetts</i>!"</p>

<p>"Say, Polly, look out for that <i>Manhattan</i>
bunch."</p>

<p>"Hi, Chalmers, you're the man. You're carrying
the <i>Luzzy's</i> money."</p>

<p>"That's right, and don't you forget it."</p>

<p>"And you, Strong! My month's pay's on
you."</p>

<p>"You'll lose, then; Merritt's the man."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Carter? Guess you'll
know there's a <i>Kansas</i> in the fleet."</p>

<p>"Stand back, please! Stand back!" cried
those in charge of the course.</p>

<p>The line-up was quickly arranged. The starters
crouched ready to dart off. Carter made a
false start, and the excitement waxed furious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ready?"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Steedforth, of the <i>Louisiana</i>, the
starter, put the question.</p>

<p>Like greyhounds preparing to leave the leash,
the contestants flexed their muscles.</p>

<p>The starter lifted the pistol. A puff of smoke
and sharp report followed.</p>

<p>Merritt, Chalmers and Polthew got off at the
same instant. They made a showy start, and the
grandstand as well as the field buzzed with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Springer, of the <i>Merrimac</i>, and Carter, of the
<i>Kansas</i>, came next. Strong came last, and was
almost unnoticed in the frenzy of excitement.</p>

<p>The pace was terrific. In the first twenty-five
yards Polthew and Carter dropped behind, hopelessly
out of it. Far in front, Merritt, Chalmers
and Springer were fighting it grimly out.
Springer hung like death on the heels of the
two leaders.</p>

<p>Ned had crept up, and kept his pace steadily.
Suddenly Springer spurted. This carried him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
past Chalmers and Merritt, who were about even.
But the effort had been made too soon. In a
second's time he dropped back again.</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boy knew that the two tricksters
in front were going to concentrate on stopping
him if he crept up too soon. So he crawled
up till he felt it would be foolish to delay longer.
Then, letting out all his reserve power, Ned
spurted. His burst of speed was easy and genuine.
It was not forced.</p>

<p>In a flash he was abreast of Chalmers before
the latter could "pocket" him according to prearranged
plans. Merritt, as he saw this, exerted
every ounce of strength in his wiry body.</p>

<p>The jackies went wild. It was anybody's race,
for now Chalmers had recovered from his surprise.
Spurting, he caught up with the leaders.
Spurt followed spurt. The air vibrated with
cheers, yells, whoops and every kind of noisy
demonstration.</p>

<p>Above it all, there suddenly rang out from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
throats of the <i>Manhattan's</i> crew, one ear-splitting
cry of triumph.</p>

<p>In the midst of it, carried on its wings as it
were, Ned suddenly dashed ahead of his competitors
and staggered across the tape into the arms
of his shipmates. Chalmers was second and
Merritt a bad third. Tobacco had found the
weak spot in his heart. He was almost exhausted
as he reeled across the line.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE AERO SQUAD.</p>


<p>One by one the other contests were decided.
The hammer throw was won by Melvin, of the
<i>Idaho</i>, a giant of a man. Smithers, of the <i>Manhattan</i>,
was second in this event. So the Dreadnought's
crew continued to keep up their spirits.
The half-mile was captured by Remington, of
the <i>Louisiana</i>, while the mile went to Hickey, of
the <i>Manhattan</i>, a man with hair of right good
fighting red, and a great chest development.</p>

<p>Then came the pole jump. As usual, this picturesque
event excited great interest.</p>

<p>Chance came first, and set a mark that made
the other contestants gasp.</p>

<p>"You'll have to be a grasshopper to beat that,
Herc," whispered Ned.</p>

<p>Herc nodded. "I'll do my best," he said simply.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff, shipmate," said "Ben Franklin,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
who happened to be close at hand, "as poor
Richard said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'You'll beat the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If you do your best.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I never saw that in 'Poor Richard' that I can
recollect," said Ned, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Steve Wynn looked pained, as he usually did
when any of his quotations was questioned as to
its accuracy.</p>

<p>"It's in the book some place," he said confidently.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe it is," agreed Ned. "It's good
advice, anyhow."</p>

<p>At last came Herc's turn.</p>

<p>Merritt had now been joined by Chance. With
set teeth, they stood watching the agile lad from
the farm prepare for his preliminary run.</p>

<p>"You want to watch closely now," said Chance,
with an unholy grin, "you're going to see something."</p>

<p>"What? You've&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>But a horrified cry from the spectators interrupted
the words. Herc had risen gracefully at
the bar, and had seemed about to sail over it.
Instantly bedlam had seethed about the field.</p>

<p>"Taylor, of the <i>Manhattan</i>, wins!"</p>

<p>"Good boy, red-top!"</p>

<p>"Go to it, freckles!"</p>

<p>But in a flash the cries of enthusiasm had been
changed to that peculiar sighing gasp that runs
through a crowd at a sudden turn to the tragic
in their emotions.</p>

<p>As Herc had lifted his body outward to sail
over the bar, the pole had suddenly snapped beneath
him.</p>

<p>The horrified spectators saw the lad's body
hurtled downward. Herc, as he fell, narrowly
missed impalement on the jagged, broken end of
the pole. But the lad's muscles were under prime
control. Even as he fell, he seemed to make a
marvelous twist.</p>

<p>The cheers broke forth anew as Herc, instead
of landing in a heap, came to earth gracefully on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
his feet. He had not sustained the least injury,
a fact which he soon demonstrated to the judges
and other officials of the track who crowded
about him.</p>

<p>"I tell you, it's that blamed secret of theirs,"
growled Chance, turning pale.</p>

<p>"We'd better get out of here," warned Merritt
hastily. "Look, they are examining the pole. I
imagine that they'll find it was cut."</p>

<p>"I imagine so, too," said Chance, in a low,
rather frightened tone, as the unworthy two
hastened off. "But they can't prove anything on
me," he added defiantly.</p>

<p>In the meantime Herc had selected another
pole. He examined it carefully and found it
perfect. Bracing himself for the effort of his
life, he essayed the jump once more.</p>

<p>He sailed over the bar as gracefully as a
soaring sea gull.</p>

<p>"Chance is tied! Taylor's tied him!" yelled
the crowd.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Herc," whispered Ned, as Herc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
prepared for a fresh effort. "Now this time beat
him, and beat him good."</p>

<p>Herc set his teeth grimly. His usually good-natured
face held an expression very foreign
to it.</p>

<p>"I'll do it," he said. "And then," he added
significantly, "I've got another job to attend to."</p>

<p>Flexing his muscles, Herc crouched for an instant.
Then he hurled himself at the bar. He
cleared it with almost six inches to spare above
Chance's hitherto unapproached record.</p>

<p>If the field had known enthusiasm before, it
was pandemonium that broke loose now. Like
wild-fire, the word had gone about that Herc's
pole had been tampered with. The spirit of the
Yankee blue-jacket is keen for fair play. A foul
trick stirs his blood as nothing else will. If
Ned or Herc had breathed their suspicions at
that instant, it is likely that, in spite of discipline,
it would have gone hard with Merritt and
Chance. But Herc sought another way.</p>

<p>That night word ran through the fleet that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Hercules Taylor, of the <i>Manhattan</i>, had challenged
Chance, of the same ship, to a boxing
match, and that Chance had refused. Possibly
he anticipated that Herc might lose control
of himself and strike out a little harder than is
consistent with "sparring." At any rate, from
that time on, Chance was rated as "a flunker,"
which, in the navy, is a very undesirable appellation.</p>

<p>Herc, however, was the idol of the <i>Manhattan</i>.
His winning of the pole jump had captured the
athletic supremacy pennant for the <i>Manhattan</i>.
It had been the climax of a day of triumphs for
the lads of the Dreadnought. From thenceforth
the big fighting craft was entitled to float both
the athletic pennant and the coveted "Meat Ball,"
the latter the red flag for the best gunnery.
How the meat ball was won at Guantanamo,
readers of "<i>The Dreadnought Boys on Battle
Practice</i>" are aware.</p>

<p>It was on a Monday, a week after the sports,
that a line of trim, athletic looking, young blue-jackets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
were lined up in a field, some ten miles
out of Hampton, and in the heart of a rural community.
Off, at one side of the meadow, was a
row of barn-like structures, painted a dull gray
color and numbered. There were six of them.</p>

<p>These sheds housed the aeroplanes with which
the experiments for the purpose of selecting a
naval "aerial-scout class" were to be conducted.
The eyes of the row of aspirants, who had been
winnowed from a perfect crop of such applicants,
were fixed longingly on the gray barns.
They housed, not only the aeroplanes, but the
ambitions and hopes of that row of young men&mdash;the
pick of the squadron.</p>

<p>But there were more than twenty candidates
for the scout corps lined up, and only nine would
be selected. No wonder that there was anxiety
reflected in their eyes, as Lieutenant De Frees
and his assistants, Ensigns Walters and Jackson,
paced down the row of blue-jackets, putting
questions here and there, and weeding out
those who were either too heavy or cumbersome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
for aero work, or else did not give evidence of
the keen, hawk-like intellectual faculties that an
airman must have. These include the power of
instant decision in an emergency, courage of a
high order, but not recklessness, and a mind
capable of grasping the mechanical qualities of
the craft with which they have to deal. As may
be imagined, then, the task of the officers was
not a simple one.</p>

<p>One by one, the eager applicants were sorted
and sifted, till finally, the chosen nine stood
shoulder to shoulder. Ned and Herc had both
passed, although, for a time, the fate of the latter
had hung in the balance. His heavy frame
was against him. But the naval officers had
decided that the lad's quick intelligence and bulldog
tenacity made him desirable in other ways.
For the present Herc Taylor would be held in
reserve. There was a certain grim suggestiveness
in this&mdash;a hint of the dangers of aerial navigation
which might result in the ranks being
thinned before long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned had had no trouble in getting by. Lieutenant
De Frees had said with a pleasant nod:</p>

<p>"I've heard of you, Strong. We want you.
You are, of course, willing to sign a paper absolving
the navy from responsibility in case of
your death or serious injury?"</p>

<p>This question had been put to all the applicants
in turn. They had all signified their willingness
to do this. It was understood, of course,
that the contract, or pledge, did not in any way
affect their pensions or "disability" money.</p>

<p>When Ned's turn came, he thought a moment.
Such was his habit. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>"If I'd thought only of the risks, sir, I wouldn't
be here," he said, in a respectful but decisive
manner.</p>

<p>Among the others who passed the ordeal
were Merritt and Chance; a slender, greyhound-like
chap from the <i>Kansas</i>, named Terry
Mulligan; a bos'un's mate from the <i>Louisiana</i>,
called Sim Yeemans, a typical Yankee from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Vermont, or "Vairmont," as he called it; a comical
German blue-jacket from the <i>Idaho</i>, Hans
Dunderblitz, and some others whom we shall
probably become acquainted with as our narrative
progresses.</p>

<p>The disappointed ones were spun back to the
ships in a big auto chartered for the purpose.
The successful candidates and the defeated ones
parted without animosity.</p>

<p>"Better luck next time," hailed the chosen nine,
as their shipmates drove off.</p>

<p>"Oh, your ranks will thin out quick enough,"
cried one of the departing ones, with sinister
humor.</p>

<p>The men selected for the aviation "classes,"
as they may be called, were, they soon found out,
to board at a big stone farmhouse not far from
the aviation field. Little more was done that
day than to pay a series of visits to the different
sheds&mdash;or "hangars," in airmen's parlance. In
each of these the embryo airmen listened to a
short talk on the type of machine they were viewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and heard its qualities discussed. In addition,
that night, each of the ambitious ones received
a set of books on the science of mastering
the air, with instructions to study them carefully.
It was implied that those who failed to
pass certain examinations at a future date would
not be allowed to partake further in the experiments.</p>

<p>"Well, talk about your ease and luxury," said
Herc that night when the Dreadnought Boys
were in the room assigned to them at the farmhouse,
"we're as well off here as middies at Annapolis.
What a contrast to the forecastle! I
feel like a millionaire already."</p>

<p>"Umph!" grunted Ned, who was already deep
in his books. "You'd better get to work and
study. We've lots of hard work ahead of us."</p>

<p>"And excitement too, I guess," said Herc, dragging
a bulky volume toward him.</p>

<p>Neither of the two lads at the time fully appreciated
how much of both was shortly to be
crowded into their lives.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">UNCLE SAM'S MEN-BIRDS.</p>


<p>"Py golly, dot feller Neddie he fly like vun
birdt, alretty, ain'd it?" exclaimed Hans Dunderblitz
one day two weeks later.</p>

<p>He was standing by the side of Herc Taylor,
watching the evolutions of the bi-plane of Bright-Sturgess
model, which Ned Strong was manipulating
far above them.</p>

<p>"You're pretty good yourself, Hans," encouraged
Herc.</p>

<p>"Ach nein! Efferey time I gedt oop midt der
air I schneeze. Undt den&mdash;down I go tumble,
alretty."</p>

<p>"You'll have to learn to stop sneezing," commented
Herc; "maybe the engine doesn't like it&mdash;see
a doctor."</p>

<p>"Phwat's thot about docthors?" asked Mulligan,
coming up. "Shure talkin' uv doctors reminds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
me uv one we had at home in Galway. He
was a successful docthor, understan', but whin
he wos a young mon he was not so well-to-do.
In fact, the only ornament he had in his parlor
was Patience on a Monument, a stathoo, ye understan'.
Wun day a frind calls ter see him in
the days whin the doc was prosperous.</p>

<p>"'Doc,' says he, 'you ain't got Patience on a
Monument any more.'</p>

<p>"'No,' says the docthor, says he, 'shure I've
got monumints on all my patients now, begob!'"</p>

<p>"Puts me in mind of what I once read in a
paper up in the Catskills," laughed Herc. "The
item read: 'Dr. Jones was called, and under
his prompt and skilful treatment Hiram Scroggs
died Wednesday night.'"</p>

<p>"By Chermany, dere vos a docthor vunce&mdash;&mdash;"
began Hans.</p>

<p>But what the doctor "by Chermany" did or
said, was destined not to be known, for an order
came to the group to resume their practice. Immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
they hastened off to get their machines
in trim once more.</p>

<p>Lieutenant De Frees' system of instruction
had proved effectual. By this time almost all of
his squad had learned to fly. Some of them
could only take "grasshopper jumps," but others,
Ned, Merritt and Chance among them, had
proven themselves really capable airmen. They
had learned with wonderful aptitude.</p>

<p>Ned would never forget his first day in an
aeroplane. The officer had taken up a biplane
and given a daring exhibition. Then he descended
and announced that instruction would
begin. His assistants took up Herc and Merritt,
while Ned was ordered to seat himself on the
narrow little place beside the officer. The Dreadnought
Boy experienced then, not exactly fear,
but a curious sort of sinking feeling born of his
initiation into a hitherto unknown experience.
He braced his feet against the slender struts of
the machine, as he was instructed, and held
tightly to the handholds provided for the purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Then he stole a glance at Lieutenant De Frees.
The officer's face was as calm as that of a man
who was about to take an afternoon's drive behind
a favorite horse.</p>

<p>Suddenly the officer twitched a brass contrivance
attached to a quadrant on his steering
handle, which was not unlike that of an automobile.
He pressed a pedal with his foot and
a mighty roar and vibration began at once as the
motor opened up.</p>

<p>The acrid reek of castor oil, which is used
to lubricate aeroplanes, filled the air. The stuff
was expelled from the cylinder vents in blue
clouds, shot with lambent smoky flame. The
mighty power exerted by the eight cylinders
shook the frail fabric of the aeroplane as an
earthquake might.</p>

<p>"Hold on tight now!" shouted the officer to the
pupils, who were gripping the machine tightly,
grasping on to the rear structure. Had they not
done so, it would have darted off at once before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the two propellers gained top speed and driving
power.</p>

<p>"Now!" shouted the officer suddenly.</p>

<p>Instantly they let go, as they had been instructed.
Ned felt as if he had suddenly been
plunged into a runaway express train that was
careening over a newly ploughed field. The
shocks and vibration of the machine, as it rushed
straight forward, like a scared jackrabbit, over
the uneven surface of the field, made it hard
to hold on.</p>

<p>Just as Ned felt that he must inevitably be
hurled from his seat, the motion suddenly
changed. The contrast was violent. From the
jouncing, rattling, bumping onrush of a second
before, the novice seemed to have been suddenly
transported to the softest of feather-beds. The
aeroplane glided upward without any apparent
effort. It appeared to Ned as if the land was
dropping from under his feet, rather than that
they were rising from the earth.</p>

<p>Higher they soared and higher. Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
their pleasant drifting, as it seemed, though the
aeroplane was making sixty miles an hour,
changed to a terrifying drop.</p>

<p>It was like rushing downward in a runaway
elevator. Ned choked, caught his breath, and
turned faint and dizzy. Without wishing to do
so, he found himself compelled to close his eyes.
The qualms of incipient nausea began to rack
him. His head pained, too.</p>

<p>"Gracious," he thought impatiently, "what's
the matter with me, anyway? Am I a baby or a
girl? If the lieutenant can stand it, I can."</p>

<p>With a supreme effort of will, the Dreadnought
Boy compelled himself to open his eyes. He
stole a side glance at his companion. Lieutenant
De Frees was as cool as an iceberg.</p>

<p>"I must be, too," thought Ned, steeling himself.
As he did so, the alarming downward motion
ceased. They began to rise once more,
swinging upward and climbing the sky in long,
lazy circles.</p>

<p>It was then and there that Ned's attack of air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
fever left him, never to return. Compared to
the experiences of his companions, he learned
later he had had a comparatively mild attack.</p>

<p>Ned now began to look about him. The other
two aeroplanes were soaring below them, like big
birds of the buzzard kind. He felt a wild desire
suddenly gripping his heart to go higher&mdash;right
up among the fleecy clouds that hung above
them. Perhaps the officer read his thoughts. At
any rate, they continued to climb the aerial staircase.
At a height of four thousand feet, they
plunged into a fog. The sudden change from
the bright sunlight was bewildering.</p>

<p>"We are passing through one of those clouds
that you saw from below," volunteered the officer.
He glanced at the barograph and read off
to Ned the height to which they had arisen.</p>

<p>"Good gracious," thought the lad, "four thousand
feet above the earth, and nothing between
me and it but the soles of my shoes!"</p>

<p>But Ned's terror had gone. He began to take
a real interest in the operation of the aeroplane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
now. It was fascinating to a degree. All at
once they emerged from the wet fog bank and
glided into the sunlight. Condensed moisture
covered the planes. Drops of water, turned to
miniature rainbows by the sunlight, slid down
the wire stays and supports.</p>

<p>"Want to go higher?" asked the officer presently.</p>

<p>"If you want to, sir," said Ned.</p>

<p>"We might as well. You are standing it
splendidly, Strong."</p>

<p>Ned felt himself glow with pleasure. Words
of praise from an officer are not plentiful in our
or any other navy. But, as we have seen, the
discipline on the aviation squad was not exactly
as rigid as on board a battleship.</p>

<p>But presently Ned's pleasant glow gave way to
a shivering sensation. It was growing bitterly
cold. His teeth chattered and his hands turned a
beautiful plum color. The moisture from the
cloud began to freeze on the machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Enough for to-day," decided the officer, and
he started to descend.</p>

<p>The drop was rapid, yet now that Ned was
more used to it, he felt no particular alarm. In
an incredibly short time, so it seemed, the earth
rushed up to meet them, and they landed on the
aviation field as lightly as a wind-wafted feather.</p>

<p>The next day Ned and the two other most
proficient pupils&mdash;Merritt and Chance&mdash;were
given a chance to handle the levers alone. They
acquitted themselves well. Their advancement
proved rapid, living up to the promise of their
first efforts. On the day which we described at
the beginning of this chapter, Ned, as we have
seen, was capable of handling an aeroplane alone.
So were Merritt and Chance. Herc was a fair
airman, and the others were progressing favorably.</p>

<p>But the real rivals of the air were, at present,
Ned, Merritt and Chance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">NED INVENTS SOMETHING.</p>


<p>"What are you so busy over, my lad?" inquired
Lieutenant De Frees one morning, stopping
in front of the Dreadnought Boys' hangar.</p>

<p>Ned looked up from the sheet of paper over
which he had been poring. It was covered with
figures and geometrical scrawlings made by a
stumpy lead pencil.</p>

<p>The lad was a bit abashed. Herc was busy
tuning up his aeroplane, and Ned, by this time,
should have been busy on his machine, for it
was a clear, calm day, ideal for a flight. But
Ned had not yet even donned his aviation togs.
Instead, he had been putting in the best part of
an hour on his figuring, bending over it with a
puckered brow. A moment before the officer
had poked his head in at the door, the boy had
started up with a glad cry:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Herc, I've got it!"</p>

<p>"Catching?" inquired Herc, as he tightened
the turnbuckle of a slack stay-wire.</p>

<p>"I hope so," laughed Ned. "I hope it proves
catching enough for Uncle Sam to adopt. You
see, an aeroplane fitted with pontoons&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, choke it off. I've heard it all a hundred
times," began Herc, and then, dropping his bantering
expression, the freckled lad went on:</p>

<p>"It's a great thing, Ned, not a doubt of it. But
are you sure you've got it at last?"</p>

<p>"Certain sure," smiled Ned confidently; "it
was to attain cubic capacity, combined with
strength and lightness, that bothered me. But I
think I've figured it out now so that it will work."</p>

<p>So saying, he had resumed his calculations and
had been engaged on them but a few seconds
when the interruption occurred.</p>

<p>"Why, it's an idea I've been working out for
some time, sir," said Ned modestly, in reply to
the officer's question. "I'd rather like to have
your opinion on it, sir, if it isn't too much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
ask. You see, it's a scheme to attach pontoons
to an aeroplane, making the machine practicable
for both air and water. Inasmuch as our experiments
are to select a naval type, it seemed to me
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A machine that could fly and swim, too, if
necessary, would be a great thing," broke in the
officer enthusiastically. "Well, my boy, if you
really have such an idea in practicable shape, I
think I can encourage you to hope great things
for it. Any one of a hundred manufacturers
would be willing to buy your secret and pay you
well for it, too."</p>

<p>Ned flushed. A flicker of something akin to
indignation crossed his face.</p>

<p>"If it's any good, sir," he said quietly, "I intended
that our navy should have it."</p>

<p>The officer brought down his hand with a
hearty slap on Ned's broad shoulder.</p>

<p>"Good for you," he said. "I spoke as I did to
test your motives in working on this invention,
and I am not disappointed in you. If you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
visit me at my quarters to-night, we'll talk more
of the matter."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," rejoined Ned, flushing gratefully,
and his eyes shining, "at what time, sir?"</p>

<p>"About nine o'clock. I've some friends coming
over this evening and shall not be at liberty before
that time."</p>

<p>Ned saluted, and Herc likewise clicked his
heels together and raised his hand, as the officer
left the hangar to resume his morning tour of
inspection.</p>

<p>The tall form of their superior had hardly
vanished from the doorway before Herc, who
had turned to search for some tool, gave a sudden
sharp outcry.</p>

<p>There was a small window, high up in the
rear of the shed, which had been left open for
ventilation. As Herc turned, he was as certain
as he was that it was daylight, that he had seen
a face vanish quickly from the casement. Its
owner had evidently dropped from the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
through which he had chosen to spy on the
Dreadnought Boys.</p>

<p>"What's up, Herc?" asked Ned, as he caught
his chum's smothered exclamation.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why," exclaimed Herc, "I could be
almost certain that I saw the face of Chance
vanish from that window as I turned round."</p>

<p>"Eavesdropping, eh?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it. I guess he saw Lieutenant De
Frees come in here and remain longer than ordinarily.
It must have aroused their curiosity."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'they'?"</p>

<p>"Merritt and Chance, of course. You know
how much love they bear us. I guess they felt
afraid we were stealing a march of some kind
on them.</p>

<p>"It's a mean trick!" continued Herc. "If I'd
only caught him before I'd&mdash;I'd have bust his
face."</p>

<p>"Let's go round to the back of the shed. We
can soon find out if anyone was really there, or
if your imagination played you a trick."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Herc readily agreed. He was fairly boiling
with anger. But, on investigation, the fresh
paint at the rear of the shed proved not to be
scratched, as must have been the case had any
one clambered up to the window.</p>

<p>"Looks to me as if you're seeing things,"
teased Ned.</p>

<p>"Does look rather like it," confessed Herc.
"It seems as if&mdash;hullo, what&mdash;what's that? I
guess that's how he reached the window without
scratching the paint."</p>

<p>He pointed to a short ladder, evidently left
behind by the workmen who had fitted up the
hangars. It lay in some tall grass, a short distance
from where the Dreadnought Boys stood.
A hasty attempt seemed to have been made to
hide it, but if this had been the case, it was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>"Just as I thought," declared Herc, after a
minute. "The grass here is freshly trampled by
the chap who threw the ladder back."</p>

<p>Ned was silent a minute. Then he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder how much they overheard?" he said
slowly.</p>

<p>"All our conversation, I guess, if they arrived
in time. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I wanted to keep my pontoon idea
secret till I'd tried it out. It isn't exactly for
general publication&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>Herc seemed to catch a deeper meaning in the
words.</p>

<p>"You're thinking of that chap who's been
snooping around here for the last week posing as
a newspaper photographer?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm convinced, somehow, that he is
nothing of the sort. For one thing, he's far too
curious about the mechanical details of the aeroplanes,
and the results of the experiments so far
as we've conducted them. Another thing is, that
he seems unusually well supplied with money, and
he also appears to be a man of far greater ability
than his supposed job would indicate."</p>

<p>"Gee whillakers!" gasped Herc. "You're not
after thinking he's a foreign spy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's just what I am," rejoined Ned firmly.</p>

<p>"He won't get much information here."</p>

<p>"Not if he depended on most of us for it. But
there's Chance and Merritt. It's a mean thing to
say, Herc, but I wouldn't trust those fellows any
farther than I could see them, and not so far as
that."</p>

<p>"We-el!" whistled Herc, with huge assumed
surprise, "you don't say so? I was always under
the delusion that they were honest, above-board
sports, who wouldn't do a mean thing for all the
wealth on Wall Street."</p>

<p>But just then the assembly bugle rang out
sharply, summoning the aero squad to its labors.
The lads hastened to get their machines out on
the field. As they trundled them forth, assisted
by some of the men employed about the grounds
for such jobs, Ned's machine almost collided with
a short, rather thick-set man, with a huge pair
of moustaches and luxuriant blonde hair. The
latter hung in a tangle from under a battered
derby hat. The rest of the man's garments were
in keeping with his disreputable head-gear. They
consisted of a long, and very greasy-looking
frock coat, a pair of checked trousers, badly
frayed at the bottoms, broken boots and a soiled
shirt and collar.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i3large.jpg"><img src="images/i3.jpg" width="400" height="586" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p>Sigmund Muller, free-lance photographer, bore an indescribable air of
being something other than he pretended to be.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Over his back was strapped a black leather
box, which evidently contained a camera, for under
his arm he bore a folded tripod. But, despite
his disreputable appearance, Sigmund Muller,
free-lance photographer, as he termed himself,
bore an indescribable air of being something
other than he pretended to be. Ned was skilled
in reading human faces, and the first time he had
set eyes on Herr Muller, he had decided that
under the battered exterior and slouching gait
lay hidden a keen, lance-like intellect, and an unscrupulous
daring. The lad was impressed with
the conviction that here was a man to be reckoned
with.</p>

<p>As the advancing aeroplane almost knocked
him down, Herr Muller jumped nimbly to one
side. Then he assumed what was meant to be a
free-and-easy sort of manner.</p>

<p>"Chust for dot," he exclaimed, "I dakes me
a picdgure of your aeromoplane. Yes&mdash;no?"</p>

<p>He began to unsling his camera, but Ned
stopped him in a flash.</p>

<p>"Don't bother yourself," he said sharply.
"You recollect that I told you the other day that
it was against the rules to take pictures of any
of the aeroplanes on the grounds."</p>

<p>"Undt I voss ordered off, too," chuckled Herr
Muller, without displaying the slightest trace of
irritation, "budt, you see, mein young friendt, I
coom back&mdash;yah."</p>

<p>"Do you mind standing out of the way?" cut
in Herc suddenly. "I'd hate to run you down, but
if you stand in the road any longer I'll have to."</p>

<p>Once more Herr Muller jumped nimbly aside.</p>

<p>"Dot'll be all righdt," he said amicably, "go
on! Go ahead! Some day you break your neck,
undt den I take picdgure of you&mdash;yes, no?"</p>

<p>He fixed the freckled-faced boy with a glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a><br /><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a><br /><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
as he spoke. Herc, despite his usual equanimity,
felt a shudder run through him, as he encountered
the look. It seemed to penetrate like the
white-hot flame of a blow-pipe.</p>

<p>"Whoof!" he exclaimed, as he hastened along,
"that chap's about as pleasant a thing to have
around as a rattlesnake. He gives me the
shivers."</p>

<p>As the Dreadnought Boys hastened to the assembling
place, Merritt and Chance, with their
machines, emerged. They passed close to Herr
Muller, and as they went by he overheard every
word they said.</p>

<p>"So Ned Strong is trying to sneak into favor
again, eh?" snarled Merritt, who had just been
listening to Chance's account of what he had
overheard at the hangar window.</p>

<p>"Yes, confound him. I wish we could find
some way to put them both out of business. If
it wasn't for them, we'd be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A soft touch on Chance's arm interrupted him.
He faced round and was rather startled to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the shambling figure of Sigmund Muller at his
elbow. The man's face bore a peculiar, searching
look. Chance felt a sort of shiver run
through him as he faced him. But he shook it
off.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" he demanded gruffly.</p>

<p>"You were talking about Ned Strong and Herc
Taylor and some plans they had?" said the photographer
in quiet tones.</p>

<p>"Why, y-y-y-yes," stammered Chance, rather
taken aback. But then, with a return to his former
bravado: "What business have you eavesdropping,
anyhow? What business is it of
yours, eh?"</p>

<p>The other paid no attention to this outburst.</p>

<p>"You don't like Ned Strong or Herc Taylor?"
he said in the same even tone.</p>

<p>"Like them," repeated Chance indignantly, "I
should say not, I hate&mdash;but what do you want
to know for?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't like them either," was the
reply. "If you'll meet me at eight o'clock to-night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
at the old barn, the other side of the stone
bridge on the Medford Road, I'll have a proposition
of interest to make to you."</p>

<p>"What do you think I am&mdash;crazy, as you are?"
burst out Chance. "Meet you to talk moonshine?
What could you do?"</p>

<p>"Put you in the way of making a lot of money,"
was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Money!" Chance laughed scornfully. "Why,
you're nothing but a hobo yourself. If you
know where there's so much money, why don't
you&mdash;&mdash; Great Scott!"</p>

<p>Herr Muller had quietly thrust his hand into
an inside pocket and withdrawn an immense roll
of bills. Chance could see that they were all of
big denominations. But he only got a brief look
at the roll, for it was almost instantaneously replaced.</p>

<p>"Well," said Herr Muller, with a quiet smile
tinged with some contempt, "what do you think
of my credentials?"</p>

<p>"They're&mdash;they're all right," gasped Chance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
still staring as if fascinated at the shabby figure
before him.</p>

<p>"You and your friend will agree, then, that I
am worth talking business with?"</p>

<p>The other thought a minute.</p>

<p>"My name's Chance, and I'll take one," he
said, as he turned and swiftly hastened off. He
had lingered a long time and faced a reprimand.
But he took it philosophically, for an idea had
occurred to him, a plan which might be the means
of freeing himself and his chosen companion
from what they deemed the drudgery and hardships
of the life of a sailor.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A RESCUE BY AEROPLANE.</p>


<p>"Men, I have an announcement to make," said
Lieutenant De Frees, when they had all assembled
with their various types of machines. Ned
noticed that the officer held in his hand a sheet
of blue paper of official appearance. It was
closely covered with typewritten matter.</p>

<p>"Py golly, vot now comes?" whispered Hans
to Mulligan.</p>

<p>"Whist, can't ye, and listen to the officer!"
warned Mulligan.</p>

<p>Like the rest, the two whisperers fell into attitudes
of deep attention.</p>

<p>"As you all are aware," began the officer, "it
is the purpose of the navy to determine the advisability
of equipping every vessel in the fleet
with an aeroplane suitable for bomb dropping or
scout duty. Naturally one of the most essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
features of such a craft would be its ability to
fly both to and from the parent ship. In other
words, not only must it be able to fly from the
ship to the shore, a comparatively simple matter,
but it must be able to land back on the deck of
the ship from whence it came&mdash;a far more hazardous
feat."</p>

<p>"Vos is idt, dot 'haz-az-abluss'?" whispered
Hans.</p>

<p>"You all follow my meaning?" asked the
officer.</p>

<p>A chorus of "Aye, aye, sir," came from the
throats of the "Aviation Class."</p>

<p>"Py Chimmy Hill, I follow you all righd, budt
I'm a long, long vay behindt, as der terrapin remarked
to der rappit," commented Hans in a low
undertone which was lost in the hearty roar of
the concerted response.</p>

<p>"Very good," resumed the officer. "Now, then,
I have here," he referred to the sheet of typewritten
paper, "an announcement from the department
that one week hence a landing platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
will be erected on the after-deck of the <i>Manhattan</i>.
She will anchor in the Roads, and those
desiring to attempt the feat of landing on her
deck may notify me at the earliest opportunity.
I may add, that to the successful aviator, will
accrue an award of $100, beside certain promotion
for efficiency."</p>

<p>"Nodt for vun million billion bundtles of dollars
vould I preak my neck," commented Hans to
Mulligan.</p>

<p>"By gorry, Dutchy, I don't blame ye. 'Twould
be a day's wu-urk fer a burrd to do the thrick,"
was the response.</p>

<p>"We will now take up morning practice," came
the next announcement. "I think that some of
you are far enough advanced to try passenger
carrying across country. Strong, I assign you
to take up Taylor. Merritt, you will carry Chance
as your companion."</p>

<p>A sort of buzz of excitement ran through the
squad, as the chosen ones hurried off to make
ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"The remainder of the squad," came the next
order, "will resume ordinary practice."</p>

<p>"Dot's all ve do, is resuming," muttered Hans.
"I hope I don't resume my sneezing, py crickety."</p>

<p>It did not take Ned and Herc long to get ready.
With a buzz and whirr, they were up and into the
air before Merritt and Chance got their engines
tuned up. No directions as to the course they
should take had been given them, so Ned headed
the flying machine off inland, where fields and
hedges showed in a pretty patchwork beneath
them, with a rim of blue mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>"Say, this is great," exclaimed Herc, as they
sped on,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Take a trip up to the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Say, but it's a dream to fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From the ground we'll take a jump,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I hope we don't land with a bump."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"You're improving as a poet every minute,"
laughed Ned, his alert eyes peering straight
ahead and his hands firmly grasping the controlling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
wheel. "Let's hope you're not a prophet as
well as a poet. By the way, just take a look
round and see if you can catch a glimpse of those
other two fellows."</p>

<p>"I see them, about ten miles behind," announced
Herc presently. "They're coming right
ahead, too. Traveling at a faster clip than we
are, I judge."</p>

<p>"Let them risk their necks if they want to.
We'll jog along easily," replied Ned.</p>

<p>For some time they sped on, above pastures
and grain fields, and patches of woodland and
meadow, threaded here and there by narrow
streams which glittered in the bright sunlight like
silver ribbons. It was, as Herc had said, "great."
The blood ran faster, and every nerve tingled
invigoratingly under the stimulus of the rapid
advance through the air. All about them the
shining stay-wires hummed and buzzed, giving
out a shrill accompaniment to the steady drone
of the motor.</p>

<p>"I'll slow down a bit now," said Ned presently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
"I'm anxious to see how she'll behave at reduced
speed with extra weight on board."</p>

<p>As he shut down the power, the aeroplane descended
perceptibly. The added weight of another
passenger made her far less buoyant, as
was to have been expected.</p>

<p>They were quite low, hovering like a big hawk
above a small farm-house, when a sudden scream
from below was borne to their ears quite distinctly.</p>

<p>"Hullo! What's that?" exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>"It was a woman screaming," was the rejoinder.
"We'd better drop down and see what's
the trouble."</p>

<p>"Just what I think. It came from that farm-house."</p>

<p>"I know. Hold on tight, now; I'm going to
drop fast."</p>

<p>Like a stone the aeroplane fell. The rapidity
of the drop made both the aviators gasp. Just
as it seemed inevitable that they must be dashed
to bits on the ground beneath, Ned, by a skilful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
bit of airmanship, brought his craft to a level
keel, and alighted without a jolt.</p>

<p>They came to earth in an open meadow at the
rear of the farm-house, a white-painted, green-shuttered
place of comfortable appearance. As
the machine stopped its motion, both lads leaped
out and began running toward the house. As
they neared it, a voice struck on their ears:</p>

<p>"Come on, now; no nonsense. Give me the
money your husband has hidden here, or I'll
hurt you."</p>

<p>Had the two Dreadnought Boys been able to
see through the walls of the house, they would
have beheld a terrified woman, in a gingham
gown and white apron, cowering before a heavy-set
man, who was brandishing a stout club. The
fellow's look was desperate. His deep little eyes
glittered menacingly under heavy, black brows.
His bluish, bristly chin thrust forward truculently.</p>

<p>"Take these silver spoons," the woman begged,
"and leave me alone. They are all I have."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't try lying to me," growled the man,
stepping forward a pace. "It won't go. I've
heard around here that your husband is a miser,
and I want the money he has hidden. Come,
now, are you going to give it to me, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He raised the club threateningly.</p>

<p>The woman paled, but stood her ground
bravely.</p>

<p>"I have given you all the valuables we have
in the house," she said. "If anyone told you
my husband was a miser, they must have done
it out of malice. We are poor farmers, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll do! That'll do! I'm tired of argying
with yer. I'll look for myself. Stand aside,
and look jumpy now, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A scream burst from the woman's lips, as her
brutal annoyer came toward her, his upper lip
curled in a snarl.</p>

<p>But he had not advanced more than a couple
of paces before an unexpected interruption occurred.
A third voice struck into the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stop right where you are, Bill Kennell, or
there'll be trouble."</p>

<p>Kennell, for it was the disgraced and desperate
bully formerly of the <i>Manhattan</i>, whipped
round in a flash. His recognition of the Dreadnought
Boys, who stood in the opened kitchen
door, was swift as theirs had been of him.</p>

<p>"Ned Strong!" he exclaimed in a husky voice.</p>

<p>"Not forgetting Herc Taylor, Bill," grinned
the freckle-faced youth. "You don't seem exactly
glad to see us."</p>

<p>"Oh, whoever you are, thank heaven you have
come!" cried the woman. She reeled backward,
overcome by the reaction of her feelings, and
would have fallen if Herc had not jumped forward
and seized her in his arms.</p>

<p>At the same instant, Kennell, who had lost
none of his former agility, crouched and sprung
like a wildcat at Ned. But if he had thought
to catch the Dreadnought Boy off his guard, he
was dreadfully mistaken. Ned jumped nimbly to
one side, as Kennell rushed at him, and the bully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
carried by the impetus of his onrush, crashed
against the wall. He recovered himself in an
instant and came back at Ned with formidable
force. But once more Ned was ready for him.
The Dreadnought Boy dived suddenly, as Kennell
raised his knotted club, and, coming up under
the man's arm, caught him a blow on the
chin that caused the former bully of the <i>Manhattan</i>
to reel and stagger.</p>

<p>But, as if he had been prepared for some such
result of his onslaught, Kennell, without an instant's
loss of time, produced a pistol from somewhere
amid his tattered garments.</p>

<p>Before Ned could make another move, a hot
flame fanned his face; a loud report rang in his
ears, and he felt a sharp, stinging pain in his
head. Then he lost consciousness.</p>

<p>As he fell with a crash against a chair, bringing
it a splintered wreck to the floor with him,
Herc deposited the fainting woman on an old-fashioned
settee, and sprang with a roar of anger
at Kennell. But as he did so, two other figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
suddenly appeared in the open doorway of the
farm-house kitchen.</p>

<p>"It's Bill Kennell!" cried one of them, who was
no other than Merritt. He and Chance had seen
Ned's descent, and had dropped, too, to see if,
perchance, some bad luck had not overtaken their
rivals. Hearing the uproar in the kitchen, they
had hastened to it.</p>

<p>As Herc fairly leaped on Kennell, before the
ruffian had a chance to fire another shot, Merritt
took in the whole situation with the quick intuition
of a man of his intellect.</p>

<p>Kennell, with Herc on the top of him, was
tottering backward, and on the verge of falling
helplessly before his powerful young antagonist,
when Merritt, with a quick movement, picked up
a heavy chair. Raising it, he brought it down
with all his might on the unconscious Herc's
head. The next instant the two Dreadnought
Boys lay senseless on the floor of the kitchen, one
of them seemingly badly wounded.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HERC GETS "A TALKING TO."</p>


<p>When Ned came to himself, it was to find the
farmer's wife bending over him and laving the
wound on his head with warm water. Herc, with
a quizzical look on his face, stood nearby.</p>

<p>"Whoof!" he exclaimed, as Ned opened his
eyes. "What struck us?"</p>

<p>"I guess a bullet nicked me," grinned Ned; "it
isn't much of a wound, is it?"</p>

<p>"Only grazed the skin," the farmer's wife assured
him. "I am so thankful. It would have
been terrible if either of you had come to serious
harm through your brave act in my defence."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, ma'am," said Ned, scrambling
to his feet, "glad to have been of service.
But whatever hit you, Herc?"</p>

<p>For Herc was holding his head now, with a
lugubrious expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blessed if I know. Wish I did. I saw you
fall, and jumped in to land Kennell. I grabbed
him, and was bearing him down, when something
that felt like a locomotive hit me a fearful wallop.
Then I went to slumberland."</p>

<p>"Oh, how frightened I was, when I recovered
my senses, and saw you two brave lads lying on
the floor," said the farmer's wife, almost overcome
at the recollection.</p>

<p>"Well, unless this house is haunted by spooks,
who can hit as hard as steam-hammers, we'll have
to come to the conclusion that Kennell had some
confederates," decided Herc.</p>

<p>"The whole thing has a queer look to me," admitted
Ned, with a puzzled look. "I can't make
it out at all. You are sure that the fellow who
annoyed you had no companions, madam?"</p>

<p>"I'm certain," declared the farmer's wife positively.
"He came here soon after my husband
drove off to town. He asked for something to
eat, which I gave him. When he had finished he
frightened me by demanding money. I gave him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
what little I had, but he insisted that my husband
had more concealed about the premises. If you
had not come in time, I do not know what I
should have done. But whom have I got to
thank? You&mdash;you," looking hesitatingly at the
queer combination of aviation costume and regulation
jackie uniform the lads wore, "you aren't
soldiers, be you?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, ma'am," rejoined Herc gravely, "although
at times we are tempted to soldier."</p>

<p>"We're soldiers' first cousins," laughed Ned.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see, sailors. But then, what is that
contraption out there?" She pointed out of the
window at the aeroplane. "I saw one like it at
the county fair. Be you flying sailors?"</p>

<p>"I guess that's just what we are, ma'am,"
laughed Ned. "And that reminds me that we
must be getting along. It is going on for noon."</p>

<p>He appeared about to go, and Herc was following
his example, when the woman checked
them.</p>

<p>"Oh, you must not go till you have told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
your names," she said. "My husband would like
to thank you personally for your bravery."</p>

<p>"As for our names, they are soon given," said
Ned. "But for thanks&mdash;I guess it's the duty of
Uncle Sam's sailors to do all they can to help
the weak, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Land the bullies," finished Herc, with a flourish
of his fist.</p>

<p>"Only this time it looks as if the bully had
landed us," put in Ned, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted Herc, feeling his head ruefully.
"But," he added, cheering up vastly, "we
had him on the run, anyhow."</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed Ned, "and I see, 'by the
same token,' as Mulligan says, that he was in
such a hurry he left the spoons behind him."</p>

<p>He pointed to a scattered heap at the door
which the farmer's wife pounced upon gratefully.
The spoons were all there but one, and Kennell's
exit must have been hurried, to judge by this
fact. Evidently he had dropped them by accident
and had not tarried to pick them up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>While the farmer's wife looked on in wonderment,
and not a little fear, Ned and Herc prepared
their machine for flight. In a little less
than ten minutes' time, they had taken the air
with a roar and whirr, throwing the domestic
animals about the place into panic. Without incident
they winged their way back to the aviation
field, arriving there in time for a hearty noon-day
dinner at the farmhouse.</p>

<p>Ned's head was bandaged, and Herc's cheek
was swollen, but they volunteered no explanation
of their injuries, and Lieutenant De Frees
concluded that they had met with some slight
accident of which they did not care to speak, and
deemed it best not to ask questions.</p>

<p>During the noon-day meal, Ned watched the
countenances of Merritt and Chance narrowly.
Although he had not the slightest thing to base
his belief upon, an obstinate idea had entered his
head and would not leave it, and that was, that
they had, in some manner, something to do with
the occurrences of the morning. He mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
this to Herc afterward, but was laughed at for
his pains.</p>

<p>"It was some sort of a hard-hitting ghost that
landed me that sleep wallop," declared Herc, who,
as we know, was reprehensibly given to slang on
all occasions.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed quietly. Merritt and
Chance asked leave to go into the town, which
was not far off, and they were granted an afternoon's
furlough. In what manner they employed
it, we shall learn before long. Ned and Herc
watched them go off, arm in arm, and Herc
turned to Ned with an indignant snort.</p>

<p>"Whoof! I'll bet those chaps are up to some
more cussedness. Look how they've got their
heads together. Wonder what they are plotting
now?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, and don't much care," laughed
Ned; "tell you what, Herc, you'd better get out
and practice, instead of wasting time on speculations
over Merritt, Chance and Co. By the way,
I wonder what they would say if they knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
their old acquaintance, Kennell, was at large and
up to his old tricks?"</p>

<p>"Join him, probably. Especially if it was in
anything that would make trouble for us," returned
Herc. "But what are you going to do
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>Herc had noticed that Ned had not donned his
aviation "uniform."</p>

<p>"I? Oh, Lieutenant De Frees told me I could
get my drawings in shape for his examination of
them to-night. He is to have one or two naval
experts at his quarters, whom he is anxious to
show them to. Herc, old boy, maybe we're on the
highway to fame."</p>

<p>"Maybe you are, you mean," flashed back Herc.
"I guess I'll be the same old stick-in-the-mud
till the end of the chapter."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Use your initiative. Think up
something new in connection with our present
line of work."</p>

<p>"A new way to tumble, for instance," grinned
Herc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"There you go. That's your great fault. You
can never be serious for two minutes together."</p>

<p>"I can, too," remonstrated Herc indignantly.
"That time I was in the brig on the <i>Manhattan</i>
I was serious till&mdash;till they brought my dinner."</p>

<p>Ned couldn't help laughing at his whimsical
chum's frank way of putting things. But presently
he resumed, more seriously.</p>

<p>"Come, Herc, you don't do yourself justice.
You laugh away your real ability. Look here,
I'll give you an idea to work on. See what you
can do with it."</p>

<p>"I'm all cheers&mdash;ears, I mean," declared Herc,
leaning forward in interested fashion.</p>

<p>Ned realized that the flippant tone hid real interest.
Without seeming to notice it, he went on.</p>

<p>"One of the most needed improvements in the
modern aeroplane&mdash;I mean where it is used in
warfare&mdash;is a perfected appliance for bomb-dropping.
The present way is pretty clumsy.
An aviator has to let go of his controls with one
hand while he manipulates his bomb-dropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
device with the other. Some bit of apparatus
that would do the work, say by foot-power, would
be a big improvement, and add a whole lot to
the effectiveness of the machine using it."</p>

<p>Herc kindled to enthusiasm while Ned talked.
His careless manner vanished.</p>

<p>"That's like you, Ned," he said with real
warmth of affection, "always ready to help a
fellow out. I'll try to work out something on
the lines you suggested. It's time I did something,
anyhow. But the idea will still be yours,
no matter what I do with it."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" chuckled Ned, "didn't Shakespeare
work over old stories into great plays?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," agreed Herc, who did not care
to display his almost total darkness concerning
the late Mr. Shakespeare and his methods.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A CONSPIRACY IS RIPENING.</p>


<p>"That you, boys?"</p>

<p>The speaker emerged from a patch of gloomy
looking bushes, masking an old stone bridge.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's us all right, Herr Muller. On time,
ain't we?"</p>

<p>It was Chance who spoke. Close behind came
Merritt and another figure.</p>

<p>"Yes, you're on time, all right. But who's
that with you? I don't want outsiders mixed up
in this."</p>

<p>Merritt came forward with the third member
of the newly arrived party. "This is Bill Kennell,
an old chum of ours," he said. "He's all
right, and we may find him useful in our plans."</p>

<p>"Very well, if you'll vouch for him."</p>

<p>It was noticeable that all trace of accent had
now vanished from Herr Muller's tone. In fact,
except for a very slight trace of foreign pronunciation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
impossible to reproduce, he spoke remarkably
good English.</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll vouch for him. And now to business,"
said Merritt, seating himself on the coping
of the bridge. "You said this afternoon that
you, as representative of the New York group
of International Anarchists, would pay us well
to keep you in possession of the latest moves of
the United States navy."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," responded the other eagerly, "we
wish to know all&mdash;everything&mdash;I am authorized
to pay you well for such information."</p>

<p>"But why&mdash;why do you want it?" demanded
Chance bluntly.</p>

<p>"I will tell you. We anarchists hate all law
and order. We wish to be a law to ourselves.
All law is oppression. Such is our teaching.
Navies and armies represent power and help to
keep law and order, therefore, when the time
comes, we wish"&mdash;he paused reflectively&mdash;"to
destroy all such tools of oppression."</p>

<p>Chance, calloused as he was, gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean you would dare to destroy or try
to damage, the property of the United States?"
he gasped.</p>

<p>"I mean what I said, my young man."</p>

<p>"Oh, say, count us out, then. That's too much
for me. Say, Merritt, let's be getting back."</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute," snarled the masquerading
photographer, changing in an instant from a
docile creature into an alert, dangerous martinet,
"you can't refuse to fall in with my plans
now. If you do I shall crush you. You are in
my power now."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" scoffed Merritt. "How do you make
that out?"</p>

<p>But, though he strove to make his tone easy,
there was an under note of anxiety in it.</p>

<p>"How do I make it out? In this way, my
friends: If you are false to your promises to
me, I shall denounce you to the government
authorities. I have witnesses to all that you
said this afternoon in my room at the hotel. The
man you thought was a waiter was in my employ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
and is an anarchist, like myself. That
shabby little peddler who came to sell some cheap
jewelry was another of the same belief. They
heard all you said. Moreover, they saw you
accept money from me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you told us that all you wanted us to
do was to get those plans from Ned Strong when
he comes along this way from the lieutenant's
house to-night," gasped Chance.</p>

<p>"Yes; but I may have other uses for you. Rest
assured that you are in a web from which you
cannot escape. If you try to play false to me, I
will have you sent to the place which Uncle Sam
reserves for traitors and spies."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Merritt slyly, "we may as
well make the best of it. Let's talk business. In
the first place, did you bring the disguises?"</p>

<p>Herr Muller, as we must know him, rejoined
in the affirmative. "I have them in that old
barn," he said.</p>

<p>"Very well. The time is getting along. We
had better go up there and assume them. By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
way, have you any pistols for us? We couldn't
smuggle out our service revolvers."</p>

<p>"Pistols!" scoffed the other. "What do you
want pistols for? Are there not three of you
against one? And I will be in reserve in case
he proves too much for you."</p>

<p>"Um, I know; that's all very well," muttered
Chance, "but you don't know this fellow Strong.
He's as powerful as a bull, and will fight like a
wild-cat."</p>

<p>"But he's up against overpowering odds to-night,"
Merritt rejoined, with regained confidence.
"This is the time that Ned Strong, the
favored paragon of the navy, is going to get his&mdash;and
get it good."</p>

<p>"You can bet he is," agreed Chance and Kennell,
with clenched teeth.</p>

<p>"I've got a few scores to pay off on my own
account," added the latter.</p>

<p>"Well, here are your disguises," said Herr
Muller, striking a match and indicating a bundle
in one corner of the barn. Presently he produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
a pocket flash-lamp, and held it cautiously
while Merritt and Chance, two traitors to the
United States, invested themselves in the rough-looking
garments he had provided. They were
complete, even to false whiskers. When they
had attired themselves in the tattered clothes and
adjusted the remainder of their disguises, two
more disreputable-looking specimens of the genus
tramp than Merritt and Chance presented could
not have been imagined.</p>

<p>"You'll do finely," declared Herr Muller, with
deep satisfaction, when the preparations were
concluded. "I'd be scared of you myself, if I
met you on a dark road," he added, with peculiar
humor.</p>

<p>"How about me?" asked Kennell. "That
'Dreadnought Boy,' as they call him, knows me."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! that's so," said Herr Muller. "Well,
see here," producing a handkerchief, "tie this
over the lower part of your face and you will be
well enough disguised."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon so," agreed Kennell, adopting the
suggestion.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Ned had been practically
the guest of honor at Lieutenant De Free's quarters.
Two or three other naval officers were
present, and they all displayed frank interest in
the bright, intelligent youth and his invention,
which he explained at length.</p>

<p>"But, my dear De Frees," one of them&mdash;a
young ensign named Tandy&mdash;had declared, "you
can say all you like about the aeroplane in warfare.
In efficiency it will never take the place of
the submarine, for instance. I'm willing to
wager any amount that on any night that I held
the deck, an aeroplane, equipped with pontoons
or anything else, could not, by any possibility,
approach within a hundred yards of my vessel."</p>

<p>"You really think so, Tandy?" queried Lieutenant
De Frees good-naturedly. "Well, I tell
you what we will do: At some other time we'll
meet and talk it over. If you are still in the
same mind, we will draw up conditions for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
a test. It should be interesting and of great
value theoretically."</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Tandy, "it will demonstrate
the fact that no aerial craft could torpedo or
blew up a war vessel at night without being perceived
in time. Therefore, what is the use of
equipping the ships with such craft? They take
up valuable room and waste a lot of money
which would be better spent on guns and ordnance."</p>

<p>"I agree with you, Tandy," said Lieutenant
Morrow, a veteran of many years' service, "from
my observation of aeroplanes, one could not get
within bomb-dropping or torpedo-aiming distance
of a war vessel at night. Why, the noise of
their engines would alone betray their nearness."</p>

<p>"But what if she glided up on pontoons?"
smiled Lieutenant De Frees.</p>

<p>"The same thing would hold good," declared
young Ensign Tandy, with a confident air.</p>

<p>Of course, Ned, as a petty officer, could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
take part in this conversation, but it made a
deep impression on him. After warm good-nights
from the officers, who really felt an admiration
for this clean-cut and self-respecting,
although perfectly respectful young sailor, Ned
set out on his homeward way. In his breast-pocket&mdash;or
rather tucked inside his loose blouse&mdash;he
carried the plans of his invention.</p>

<p>It was quite dark, with the exception of a
pallid light given out by a sickly moon, that
was every now and then obscured altogether by
hurrying clouds. Ned walked along quickly, at
his usual swinging pace. His thoughts were too
much upon his invention for him to pay much
attention to his surroundings.</p>

<p>All at once, however, he stopped short and
listened for an instant. But not a sound, except
the sighing of a light, night wind in the trees
that bordered the road, disturbed the stillness.</p>

<p>"Funny," mused Ned; "I could have been certain
I saw a light flash by that old bridge right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
ahead. I guess I'm seeing things, too, like
Herc."</p>

<p>So thinking, he struck once more into his
regular pace. A few steps brought him into a
patch of velvety shadow caused by the thick-growing
shrubs and alders that edged the creek
which the bridge spanned.</p>

<p>"What a spot for a hold-up!" thought the
young man-o'-war's-man, when he entered the
blackness. As he did so, a sharp chill struck him.
A keen sense of impending danger caused him to
swing sharply around.</p>

<p>It was well he had heeded his intuition, for, as
he turned, a heavy bludgeon whistled by his ear.
It had been aimed for his head, but his sudden
and unexpected move had saved him.</p>

<p>For a breath, Ned stood rooted to the spot.
Then his eyes blazed with anger.</p>

<p>"Come on, you skulking thieves!" he cried in
a high, clear voice, "I'm ready for you!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DREADNOUGHT BOY AT BAY.</p>


<p>The Dreadnought Boy's challenge was still vibrating
when, from every side, dark figures
seemed to spring. They rushed at him like so
many tigers. Ned struck out blindly.</p>

<p>It was hard to distinguish anything in the
darkness, but twice in the first few seconds of
his desperate battle against odds, he felt his
fists encounter some one's features. The feeling
gave him a sense of distinct satisfaction.</p>

<p>"One! Two!" counted the young man-o'-war's-man
grimly, as his fists shot out right and left
like sledge-hammers.</p>

<p>But Ned knew, as well as his opponents, that
four to one are almost insurmountable odds. Already
he had knocked two of his foes sprawling,
when he was struck a blow from behind that
staggered him. But it was only for an instant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
The next moment he had turned and seized by
the throat the man who had aimed the blow. He
shook him as a terrier shakes a rat. He could
hear the fellow's teeth chatter, but it was too
dark to distinguish features.</p>

<p>In the meantime, his fallen opponents had
picked themselves up. So far the fight had progressed
in ominous silence, save for the deep
breaths and stamping feet of those engaged in
it. But now, fury at this unexpectedly stubborn
resistance brought words to the lips of his foes.
They were not nice words, and Ned thrilled with
a desire to silence their utterers, for he was a
clean-spoken boy, who hated profanity in any
form.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as if by concerted consent, his foes
ceased their separate attacks, and massed like a
wolf pack preparing to finish its prey. Ned had
hardly sensed the new situation and braced himself
to meet it before they were upon him.</p>

<p>Thud! thud!</p>

<p>The lad's fists met their mark fairly, and once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
more two of his opponents reeled back. But this
time they did not fall. Instead, they rallied to
the attack.</p>

<p>As if they had been one, all four of his assailants
hurled themselves on the Dreadnought Boy.
Strive as he would, Ned felt his arms pinioned to
his sides, and he was borne down by sheer weight
of numbers. He struggled with every steel-like
muscle in his powerful young body. With teeth
set and eyes that flamed, he fought with every
fraction of an ounce of strength he possessed.
But, with two men hanging like bulldogs to his
neck from behind, and two more clinging to his
arms and battering him in front, the lad could
do nothing. With a sickening sense of helplessness,
he felt a leg slide under his, and tottered
backward.</p>

<p>With his four foes still clinging like leeches
to him, Ned felt himself borne to earth, and then,
despite his frantic struggles, a hand was thrust
rapidly into each of his pockets. A cry escaped
him for the first time&mdash;a cry of rage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>The rascals were rifling him of the plans of
the pontoon-equipped aeroplane!</p>

<p>All at once a voice struck into the scene. Some
one was coming down the road. At the top of
a pair of lusty lungs the approaching individual
was singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A sailor's wife, a sail-or's star should be!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Star-r-r-r-r-r should be!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Star-r-r-r-r-r should be!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Herc!" shouted Ned.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, there!" came the hearty response, as
Herc, who had been sauntering along the road,
on his way to meet Ned, broke into a run. Something
in the accent of Ned's cry had warned him
that his comrade's need for help was urgent.</p>

<p>"Scatter!" came a sharp voice from one of the
hitherto silent waylayers of the Dreadnought
Boy.</p>

<p>Like so many leaves before a sharp puff of
autumn wind, they instantly dissolved into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
night. Ned, dusty, battered and furious, picked
himself up. As he did so Herc plunged into the
dark patch in which the desperate fight had taken
place. He hailed Ned and received an instant
response.</p>

<p>"What on earth has happened?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Ned soon told his story. His voice throbbed
with anger as he talked. Ned was slow to wrath,
but once aroused he was whole-souled in his
anger, and surely he had justification for his
rage.</p>

<p>"The scoundrels!" burst out Herc, "couldn't
you recognize any of them?"</p>

<p>"No. They chose the place well. I could
hardly tell you if it wasn't for your voice."</p>

<p>"I'll bet the hole out of a doughnut that Merritt
and Chance had something to do with this."</p>

<p>"I don't know. I hardly know anything I'm
so mad. At any rate I must have marked one
or two of them. My knuckles are skinned where
I hit them."</p>

<p>"Let's hope that Merritt and Chance were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
two you walloped. If so, we shan't have much
difficulty in identifying two of your assailants."</p>

<p>"You talk as if you were certain they had
something to do with it."</p>

<p>"I am," responded Herc briefly.</p>

<p>"Tell you what we'll do," said Ned, suddenly,
"let's light a match and look the ground over.
Maybe we can find some trace of the fellows'
identity. There's one thing sure, they were not
common robbers."</p>

<p>"That's evident enough. It was the plans
they were after. But who that knows about
them could use them to advantage?"</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen. In the meantime,
on second thoughts, I can do better than matches.
I've got that small electric torch I use about the
aeroplane."</p>

<p>"Good. Switch it on and we'll see what we can
see."</p>

<p>Ned drew out a small object from his pocket.
There was a sharp click and a bright ray of
light shot out. Here and there about the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the Dreadnought Boy flashed the tiny searchlight.</p>

<p>"Look here!" cried Herc suddenly.</p>

<p>In triumph he held up a tangled looking object.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Ned in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>"That's easy. It's false hair like the kind we
used on the <i>Manhattan</i> when we gave that show.
The chaps that attacked you were disguised and
this was a part of their makeup."</p>

<p>"I think so, too. But&mdash;shades of immortal
Farragut!&mdash;look here, Herc!" Ned, as he spoke,
pounced on a roll of papers lying in the dust at
one side of the road, right under a clump of alder
bushes.</p>

<p>"It's the plans!" gasped Herc.</p>

<p>"That's right," rejoined Ned, opening the roll
and glancing at its contents, "they're all intact,
too. One of the rascals that took them must have
placed them in his pocket. Then, in pushing into
this brush to escape, they were caught and
thrown out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess that's it, and a good thing for us, too.
But&mdash;gee whiz!"</p>

<p>Without another word Herc plunged into the
brush. He fought his way through it furiously.
Happening to look up while they had been talking
he had caught the glint of a pair of eyes as
the light from Ned's torch reflected in them.
One of the men had noted the loss of the plans
and had returned for them. That much was evident.
At any rate, Herc, as usual, acted before
he thought, and in two bounds was swallowed in
the brush.</p>

<p>Ned, not realizing in the least what had happened,
and half inclined to think that Herc had
gone suddenly crazy, followed instantly. Presently
he found himself at Herc's side. The
freckle-faced lad gasped out a few disconnected
sentences. Broken as they were, they apprised
Ned of what had happened.</p>

<p>"The rascal must have come back to get the
plans," he concluded; "I suppose he was watching
us and waiting his chance to emerge into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the road when the light glinted on his eyeballs."</p>

<p>"Oh, if we could only have captured him!"</p>

<p>"More especially," put in Herc dryly, "as I
recognized the man as Chance."</p>

<p>"What! You did!"</p>

<p>"Sure. I could swear to it. This is the time
they've overreached themselves. They tried to
steal the plans for some reason best known to
themselves, and failed. They tried to disguise
their part in the job and failed. I guess their
career in the navy has ended for good and all
now. In the morning we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A pair of arms were thrown round Herc's
neck from behind. Caught all unprepared, he
was carried off his feet in a flash and in a second
a stout cord had been whipped about his
wrists confining his hands helplessly behind his
back. While this had been going on Ned was
served the same trick.</p>

<p>In a trice the two Dreadnought Boys were
rendered helpless, where an instant before Herc
had been crowing over their triumph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Somebody aimed a vicious kick at Ned's face
which he dodged by rolling over on his side. At
the same time a spiteful voice snarled:</p>

<p>"Our career has ended, eh? Well, it looks to
me more as if you were rapidly approaching your
own finish."</p>

<p>The voice was that of Chance, and his chuckle
of triumph was echoed by his three companions
who stood about the recumbent boys, rejoicing
in the bit of strategy which had wrought their
undoing.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">IN THEIR ENEMIES' HANDS.</p>


<p>"Well," said Ned, in the calm, even tone which
seemed to come to him in all emergencies, "what
do you mean to do with us now?"</p>

<p>"Yah!" jeered Chance, thrusting his face forward
evilly, "you think we'll tell you, don't yer?
You just lie there and don't get up if you know
what's good for you."</p>

<p>As he spoke he produced a pistol as if to emphasize
his warning.</p>

<p>"You can't scare us in that way, Chance," resumed
Ned, "you wouldn't dare to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't know what I'd dare," retorted
Chance; "I hate you, Ned Strong, and now it's
my chance to get even with you and with your
butting-in chum."</p>

<p>"Come, don't talk any more nonsense," rejoined
Ned, "I can make allowances for a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
nature actuated by motives of meanness and
jealousy. But it's about time to end this nonsense.
We'll be late for lights out if we don't
all get back. If you'll come to your proper minds
and end this foolishness, I'll promise not to report
anything about to-night's work, unless questions
are asked, and then I'll have to tell the
truth."</p>

<p>Merritt had been talking apart with the two
others, whom we know were Herr Muller and
Bill Kennell, but whose identity was, of course,
a mystery to the boys. He now came forward.
He was just in time to catch Ned's last words.</p>

<p>"Maybe you won't get a chance to tell the truth
or anything else, Ned Strong," he said; "as for
injuring us with the navy, you couldn't do that
if you tried. We're through with it."</p>

<p>"You're going to desert?" demanded Ned.</p>

<p>"Just what I'd have expected of you two rats,"
snorted Herc.</p>

<p>"Call it deserting, if you like," parried Merritt,
"I call it quitting just as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you're a quitter all right," struck in Herc,
"a quitter from Quitterville&mdash;one of the first settlers
there, I guess."</p>

<p>"Are you going to be quiet?" hissed Chance.</p>

<p>"When I get good and ready, as the thunderstorm
said to the old maid who complained she
couldn't sleep," responded the freckle-faced lad.</p>

<p>"Leave him alone," said Merritt, "we can afford
to let them talk their heads off if they want,
to; they'll be quiet enough before long."</p>

<p>"Well, come on. Let us be moving," interpolated
Herr Muller's voice; "himmel! we have a
long tramp before us."</p>

<p>"That's right," assented Merritt, then, turning
to Chance, he went on in a low tone, "It was
a good thing that we decided on that place this
afternoon. It's not more than three miles from
here. We can get there, put these two cubs
under lock and key, and be snug in bed without
giving the alarm, if we're cautious."</p>

<p>Chance nodded and gave his unpleasant
chuckle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has Muller got the keys?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. On the plea that we wanted to explore
the place the old watchman, who hasn't been near
it for a month, loaned them to him."</p>

<p>Ned caught some of this conversation and his
heart sank. It appeared plain enough that their
rascally captors had already decided on a place
to confine them. Some isolated building, so he
judged, though what its nature could be he could
not imagine.</p>

<p>"Come, get up," snarled Chance, addressing
the lads as soon as his colloquy with Merritt was
concluded.</p>

<p>"We will when you take these bracelets off our
ankles," rejoined Herc, motioning with his head
at the ropes which bound their feet.</p>

<p>Merritt and Chance quickly cut loose the
Dreadnought Boys' foot thongs and Ned and
Herc stood erect. But if they had entertained
any idea of escape, it was quickly cut short.</p>

<p>"See this," warned Chance, tapping a pistol
which belonged to Kennell. "It's got a silencer on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
it, and if either of you try to run you'll get a dose
of lead, and, as the report isn't louder than an air
rifle, nobody will be the wiser."</p>

<p>Ned nodded.</p>

<p>"I compliment you on your generalship," he
said contemptuously.</p>

<p>A few seconds later they moved off. Muller
led the way. By his side shuffled a figure
strangely familiar to both lads, but neither of
them could place it. All their efforts to catch a
glimpse of the two leaders' features were cheated
too, both by the light and the fact that they kept
their faces studiously turned away.</p>

<p>They pressed on for a mile or two through
woods and across fields, and presently a whiff of
salt-laden air struck Ned in the face.</p>

<p>"We're getting near the sea," he thought. "I
wonder if they mean to take us off some place
in a boat?"</p>

<p>But conversation had now ceased between
Chance and Merritt, and the others were too far
ahead for the lads to catch a word. Before long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
they emerged, without warning, from a clump of
woods, directly upon a wide expanse of salt
meadows. The lonely wastes stretched as far as
the eye could see. Fleeting glimpses of moonlight,
as the clouds swept across the sky, showed
the glimmer of the ocean beyond. They could
catch the sullen roar of the surf on the beach.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, Herr Muller struck out
across the salt meadows, following a narrow
path between the hummocks of salt grass. Here
and there they crossed stretches of marshy land
where the oozy mud came to their ankles.</p>

<p>All at once there suddenly shot up from the
gloomy wastes the rectangular outlines of a large
building of some kind. As they drew closer to
the dark bulk the boys could see that the walls
were pierced with numerous windows in monotonous
rows. Soon the further fact became evident
that each window was barred. There was
something indescribably depressing about the aspect,&mdash;the
gloomy, vast outlines of the dark, deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
building ahead of them, and the pallidly
moonlit wastes of salt meadow all about it.</p>

<p>What could the place be? No light appeared
in any of the numerous apertures, and the silence
hung heavily about it. Suddenly there flashed
across Ned the recollection of a flight he had
taken some days before when he had soared
above a building which, in the daylight, resembled
this lonely place. The sight of it standing
isolated and vast in the midst of its wild surroundings
had impressed him, and on his return
he had inquired about it. They had told him
that it was an old lunatic asylum. The state
had erected it there some years before, but the
atmosphere of the salt meadows had proved malarious,
and it had been abandoned.</p>

<p>A bulbous-nosed, red-faced old tippler in the
village had also been pointed out to him as a man
who held down "a soft snap," by being appointed
"watchman" to the deserted pile. Evidently the
keys had been obtained from him and the gloomy
buildings were their destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>That this was the case they were speedily to
learn. Herr Muller approached a stout-looking
door, in the top of which was a small, grated
opening. Inserting a key he turned the lock and
flung the door open. A damp, decaying odor,&mdash;the
breath of a deserted human dwelling place,&mdash;rushed
out. In spite of himself Ned shuddered.
It reminded him of the crypt of an old church he
had inspected in Spain when the ships were on
their European cruise.</p>

<p>Muller, who seemed to know the way, threaded
several long passages carrying a candle which he
had ignited at the doorway. In this manner
they traversed a considerable distance. At every
turn fresh corridors, long and empty, appeared.
The place was a maze of passages and stairways.</p>

<p>At length he paused in front of a rather small
door at the end of a hall which, judging from the
stairs they had climbed, must have been near the
top of the building. He flung this door open,
and the next instant the candle was extinguished,&mdash;evidently
with the intention of concealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
his features,&mdash;and the boys were roughly
thrust forward.</p>

<p>If they had not been taken totally by surprise
they might have resisted. But the shoves came
suddenly, and projected them into a room
through the door before they realized what was
happening. The next instant the door clanged
behind them, just as Herc hurled himself against
it.</p>

<p>They heard the lock grate and some bolts
clang heavily as they were fastened in.</p>

<p>"Bottled!" gasped Herc, truthfully if slangily.</p>

<p>But Ned had pulled out his pocket lantern and
was examining the place in which they had been
imprisoned. He was struck by something peculiar
about it. He reached out a hand and felt
the walls. They were smooth and yielding.
They had been covered with some soft substance.
High up was a small window with thick metal
bars.</p>

<p>"What sort of a place is this?" gasped Herc
as he, in his turn, felt the yielding, cushioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
walls. "These walls feel like the upholstered
chairs in the skipper's cabin."</p>

<p>Ned battled with a catch in his voice before
he replied. He had grasped the truth of their
almost hopeless situation.</p>

<p>"Herc, old boy," he said, putting a hand on
his shipmate's shoulder, "brace up for a shock.
This place is a deserted lunatic asylum, and
they've locked us in what was formerly used as
a padded cell for solitary confinement."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"STOP WHERE YOU ARE!"</p>


<p>It is a curious fact that most absolutely overwhelming
predicaments do not at first strike in
upon their victims with the crushing force that
would be imagined. This was evidenced by
Herc's rejoinder to Ned's startling information.</p>

<p>"Great ginger!" he exclaimed, "I guess we're
in just the place where we belong. If we hadn't
gone blundering into that trap we wouldn't have
been in this fix, and if we hadn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Left the farm and enlisted in the navy we
wouldn't have been here either," retorted Ned.</p>

<p>A scrutiny of their prison confirmed Ned in
his first judgment of its character. The walls,
though padded, were solid, and seemingly impenetrable.
The window was far too high up to
be reached, and even if they could have got to
it, it could be seen that the steel bars were set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
solidly into the masonry. The door, which was
examined in its turn, proved to be likewise of
solid oak. No lock appeared on it. Doubtless
this was to prevent any of the unfortunates formerly
confined in the place from injuring themselves
on projecting bolts.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the door, however, a peculiar
contrivance appeared. It was a small, hinged
flap, which, when raised, revealed an opening
some six inches square. The thought suggested
itself to Ned that it might have been used once
as a means for giving food or drink to the incurables
confined within during their violent
spells.</p>

<p>He opened the flap and thrust his hand
through. A vague hope had entered his mind
that he might be able to reach up as far as the
bolts on the outside. If he could have done this
he could have opened them. But, as might have
been expected, this was not feasible. Ned had
the exasperating experience of being able, by the
utmost exertion, to touch the bottom of the bolt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
with his finger-tips, but that was all. Even then
he had to shove his arm so far through the hole
that it was grazed and sore when he withdrew it.</p>

<p>"W-e-l-l?" said Herc slowly, as they sank
down side by side on a sort of bench, padded like
the rest of the interior of the place.</p>

<p>"W-e-l-l?" retorted Ned, "so far as I can see,
if we were sealed up in one of the <i>Manhattan's</i>
air-tight magazines we would have just about as
good a chance of getting out as we have of escaping
from this place."</p>

<p>"Same here," agreed Herc woefully. "What
are we going to do? Do you think they'll starve
us to death?"</p>

<p>Barren of hope as the situation appeared, Ned
could not help smiling at Herc's woebegone tone.</p>

<p>"They'd hardly dare to do that," he rejoined;
"this is the twentieth century, and such things as
law and order prevail. No, I guess they have
some sort of trickery on hand with which we
might interfere, and they mean to keep us locked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
up here till they have carried out their rascally
plans."</p>

<p>"Talking of plans, did they take back the ones
of the pontoon aeroplane?"</p>

<p>"No," exclaimed Ned, brightening, "thank
goodness that's one thing they seem to have forgotten.
Anyhow I suppose they know they have
us at their mercy and can get them any time they
want them."</p>

<p>"Reckon that's it," agreed Herc.</p>

<p>Silence ensued. The two boys sat side by side
in the pitchy blackness of their prison, for Ned,
anxious to reserve it for emergencies, had extinguished
the electric torch. Neither of them was
a nervous sort of youth, but the long vigil in the
dark was enough to get on anybody's nerves.</p>

<p>"This is certainly a tough situation," remarked
Ned after a time. He spoke more for
the sake of hearing his own voice than for any
novel idea the words might convey.</p>

<p>"Not giving up, are you, Ned?" inquired Herc.</p>

<p>"Giving up?" grated out the elder Dreadnought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Boy, "I'm like Paul Jones&mdash;I've just begun
to fight."</p>

<p>"When did Paul Jones say that?" asked Herc.</p>

<p>"Why, that time that the British captain, Pearson,
peered through the smoke surrounding his
majesty's ship <i>Serapis</i> and the little <i>Bonhomme
Richard</i>.</p>

<p>"Pearson hailed Paul Jones and shouted out,
'Have you struck your colors yet?'</p>

<p>"It was then that Paul Jones sent back that
answer. Those were grand words, Herc. They
ought to be framed and placed on board every
vessel in Uncle Sam's navy."</p>

<p>"Yes, Paul Jones was a wonderful sea-fighter
all right," agreed Herc, "but I wonder what he'd
have done if he'd been cooped up in here."</p>

<p>"Figured on some way of getting out," rejoined
Ned promptly. "Time after time British
frigates hemmed him in. They thought they
had him trapped. But every time he slipped
through their fingers and resumed his career as
a sea tiger. With his little bit of a junk-shop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
fleet he did more to establish the name of Americans
as sea fighters than any man in the republic."</p>

<p>"But how about Ben Franklin, who advanced
the money to buy the ships, or at least saw that
it was raised?" asked the practical Herc.</p>

<p>"Well, of course he helped," admitted Ned,
"but even he couldn't save Paul Jones from his
country's ingratitude. Why, it was a hundred
years or more before his bones were discovered
in an obscure spot in Paris, where he died in
poverty, and were brought back to this country
and buried with the honors they deserved."</p>

<p>"Humph!" observed Herc, "that was a pretty
shabby way to treat one of our biggest naval
heroes. Wish we had him here now. What
was that old anecdote you told me once about
Paul burning his way out of a prison some
place?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" laughed Ned. "I guess that was
a bit of imagination on the part of the writer.
At any rate it isn't mentioned in the histories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
It was one time that they locked Paul Jones in
the cabin of a British vessel. They thought
they had him safe. But he ripped out the lining
of stuffed cushions of the captain's sofas and
burned a way out through a port hole that they
thought was securely locked. I read it in an old
book I picked up in Philadelphia, but I guess the
book was more fiction than fact."</p>

<p>Another silence ensued, and then Herc spoke.
He took up the conversation where it had been
left off.</p>

<p>"It's worth trying," he said in a matter-of-fact
tone.</p>

<p>"What's worth trying?" asked Ned, through
the darkness.</p>

<p>"Why Paul Jones' trick&mdash;or rather the trick
he is supposed to have played."</p>

<p>"Oh, burning himself out of prison?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't see the connection with our case."</p>

<p>"Then you are a whole lot denser than I gave
you credit for being."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thanks. But I see you've got an idea of
some sort simmering in that massive brain of
yours. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Just this, that we duplicate the trick."</p>

<p>"By ginger, Herc, there's nothing slow about
you. You mean that we burn ourselves out of
here?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I do. See any obstacles in
the way?"</p>

<p>"A whole fleet of them. For one thing we'd
suffocate ourselves if we tried to burn the door
down, which is, I suppose, what you are driving
at. Another thing&mdash;how about matches?"</p>

<p>"I've got lots of those. Now see here, Ned,"
went on Herc enthusiastically, "my plan may
seem just moonshine, but it's worth trying. You
know that little swinging trap at the bottom of
the door?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, we can build our fire <i>outside</i> the door
by thrusting our fuel through it and out into the
passage. My idea is that the flames will rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
against the surface of the door, and if we make
them hot enough will burn off the bolts without
setting the whole door on fire. The oak is thick
enough, I think, to remove all danger of that."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Ned. "There's only one thing
you haven't thought of, Herc."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"What are we going to build a fire with?"</p>

<p>"With the same stuff as Paul Jones did&mdash;or
rather stuff somewhat like it&mdash;the soft lining of
these padded walls."</p>

<p>"Say, Herc, you're a wonder! I always said
you had a great brain," cried Ned banteringly,
"but hasn't it occurred to you that your fire
would burn out the floor of the passage and set
the place on fire before it would get the bolts
hot enough to make them drop off?"</p>

<p>"It might if the floors and walls were not concrete.
I noticed them as we came along," rejoined
Herc in a quiet voice.</p>

<p>"Herc, you ought to be director of the Smithsonian
Institute or&mdash;or something big," declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Ned admiringly. "It does begin to look as if
we might have a chance to get out, after all. At
any rate, it's worth trying. It will give us something
to do."</p>

<p>"Of course it will," responded Herc cheerfully;
"and now, if you'll switch on that light of
yours, we'll start pulling the materials for our
fire off these walls."</p>

<p>It didn't take long to rip out a great pile of
the batting and shavings with which the walls
were stuffed. These were thrust through the
hole in the bottom of the door into the passage
outside as fast as they were pulled out. At last
the pile was declared large enough, and, with a
big heap in reserve for use when the other had
burned out, the boys prepared to light the mass
of inflammable stuff.</p>

<p>It blazed up fiercely when the match was applied,
but, of course, as it was outside the door
in the concrete passage, the flames did not bother
the boys or imperil the building. On their hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and knees the two young prisoners crouched,
feeding the flames assiduously when they showed
signs of dying down. There was plenty of fuel,
and a roaring fire was maintained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i4large.jpg"><img src="images/i4.jpg" width="400" height="596" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p>The remaining bolt tore loose from its blackened foundations.</p></div>
</div>

<p>All at once there was a soft thud outside the
door, and something dropped into the flames. It
was one of the heavy bolts which had torn loose
from its charred and weakened fastenings. A
few minutes later another crash announced that
the second one had fallen.</p>

<p>The lads waited a few minutes, till the fire
died down, and then, with beating hearts, they
put their shoulders to the door.</p>

<p>"Heave!" roared Ned, and the next moment,
under their united efforts, the remaining bolt
tore loose from its blackened foundations, and
the two Dreadnought Boys stood outside in the
smoke-filled passage.</p>

<p>"Let's give three cheers!" cried Herc.</p>

<p>"Better be careful about making a noise,"
counselled Ned. "No telling but some of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
rascals may be hiding in the building somewhere."</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed Herc. "Another thing
has occurred to me, too. All the windows of this
delightful place are barred, and if the door has
been locked and the place vacated, we're going
to have a hard time to get out, even now."</p>

<p>"That's right. Well, we'd better start on our
tour of exploration right away."</p>

<p>Guided by Ned, with his torch ready for instant
darkening, the two lads began to thread
the maze of corridors and passages. They had
been doing this for several minutes, and were beginning
to get rather bewildered, when Ned
stopped suddenly just as they entered a long corridor
pierced with doors, with the same monotonous
regularity as the others. He extinguished
the light in the wink of an eye, and drew Herc
swiftly into the embrasure of a doorway as he
did so.</p>

<p>Far down the corridor a footstep had sounded,
and another light had flashed. As they crouched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
in the darkness, prepared for any emergency, a
sudden voice sounded from the end of the corridor:</p>

<p>"Stop right where you are, or I'll fire!"</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HARMLESS AS A RATTLESNAKE.</p>


<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but could I speak to
you a moment?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; come in, Chance," rejoined Lieutenant
De Frees, who was sitting in his quarters
on the aviation testing ground the morning after
the events narrated in our last chapter.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's about Strong and Taylor, sir, that
I wished to speak," said Chance, twisting his cap
in his hands. His crafty face looked more fox-like
and mean than ever. His manner was
almost cringing.</p>

<p>Lieutenant De Frees jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"You've got news of them?" he exclaimed.
"Out with it, my lad. They are not the boys to
be absent without good reasons, although I fear
that if they have overstayed their leave without
just cause they must be disciplined."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's just it, sir," said Chance. "I&mdash;I don't
want to make trouble, sir, but I'm afraid that
Strong and Taylor are not all that you think
them, sir. I would have spoken at roll-call this
morning when they were reported absent without
leave, but I thought that maybe they would turn
up."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you know about them? Come,
out with it," urged the officer sharply.</p>

<p>He had never liked Chance, and the seaman's
furtive manner irritated him.</p>

<p>"Why, you see, sir, Merritt and I happened
to be in town last night, sir, and we saw Strong
and Taylor associating with some disreputable
characters, sir. We warned them, but they
laughed at us, sir. We continued to urge them
to come with us, however, but they only swore
at us."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the officer, startled out of
his official calm, "you saw Strong and Taylor in
undesirable surroundings and with disreputable
characters, and you mean to say that that is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
reason for their non-appearance this morning?"</p>

<p>"That's just it, sir," rejoined Chance. "The
last we saw of them was as they were turning
into a drinking resort. I fear that some harm
must have come to them, sir."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;confound it all, I'd almost rather
cut off my right hand than hear such a report,
Chance. You are certain that you are correct
in your report?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely certain, sir," was the response;
"there could be no mistake. I hope I am not
doing wrong in reporting this, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, no, my man, you have done perfectly
right," was the answer, although the officer's
face was troubled. The news that his most
trusted pupils should have misconducted themselves
had shaken him a good deal.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, can one place no trust in
human nature?" he thought. "I'd have staked
my commission that those boys were absolutely
clean-lived and upright."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is there anything else you'd like to know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
sir?" Chance edged toward the door as he spoke.</p>

<p>"No, no. That's all, my man. You may go."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>And Chance, his despicable errand performed,
slid through the door in the same furtive way
in which he had entered.</p>

<p>"If they haven't returned by eight bells, and
there is no news of them in the meantime, I'll
have to send out a picket to bring them in,"
mused the officer when Chance had departed.
"Then disgrace and 'the brig' will follow,
and two promising careers will be blasted.
Strong and Taylor, of all people. I can't understand
it. And yet there can be no other explanation
of their absence."</p>

<p>Dismissing the matter from his mind for the
time being, Lieutenant De Frees continued his
official work. Outside on the field his subordinates
attended to the morning practice of the
flying squad. Half an hour must have passed
thus, when a sudden knock at the door caused
him to look up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in!" he said, in a sharper voice than
usual. The news that his favorites had so fallen
from grace had distressed him more than even
he cared to own to himself.</p>

<p>In response to his words, the door swung open,
and there, framed in the doorway, stood the
two very individuals whose absence had so worried
him.</p>

<p>Ned and Herc clicked their heels together
sharply and gave the salute in a precise manner.</p>

<p>"We've reported on duty, sir," said Ned in a
steady voice.</p>

<p>The officer looked at them blankly. Their
clothes were torn, although an effort had seemingly
been made to mend them and clean them of
traces of mud and dirt. A bruise appeared on
Ned's face, while Herc's hair was rumpled and
standing up wildly. Their appearance bore out
the story the officer had heard. Two more disreputable-looking
beings it would have been hard
to picture.</p>

<p>"So this is the way you men repay my trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
in you?" said the officer in sharp, harsh tones, very
unlike his usual ones. "You will both consider
yourselves under arrest, pending an inquiry.
Remain standing till I summon a guard."</p>

<p>The lads' absolutely dumfounded looks at this
reception did not escape the officer's attention.</p>

<p>"Well, have you any explanation to offer?"
he demanded. "Mind, don't attempt to lie to me.
I know all of your proceedings, dating from the
hour that you, Strong, left my quarters."</p>

<p>"You mean that you have heard we have been
engaged in some discreditable prank, sir?" asked
Ned firmly, but respectfully, and still standing&mdash;as
did Herc&mdash;stiffly at attention.</p>

<p>"I mean just that," was the response. "Since
when has it been the custom in the United States
navy for men to disgrace the service and go
unpunished?"</p>

<p>"And yet," said Ned, in the same well-disciplined
tones, "it hasn't been the custom to condemn
men unheard, sir."</p>

<p>"I have heard quite enough, already," was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
sharp answer. "If you have anything to add to
what Chance has told me, you may. But I warn
you that any explanation you may offer will be
investigated thoroughly, and if it is found you
have been lying, it will go harder with you than
otherwise."</p>

<p>"I think you will find it is Chance who has
been lying, sir," said Ned calmly. "May I tell
you our side of the story, dating from the hour
you mentioned?"</p>

<p>"You may, but make it brief. My time is
fully occupied," was the cold response.</p>

<p>But, as Ned struck into his story, telling it in
a calm, even tone, the officer's expression changed
from one of hard incredulity to blank astonishment,
passing rapidly to deep indignation.</p>

<p>"We were startled soon after gaining our freedom,"
related Ned, going on with his narrative
from the point where we left the lads, "by the
sound of a voice calling on us to halt. A few
minutes later we found that the man who had
given the order was the local constable, Ezra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Timmons. He is a farmer on the outskirts of
the town, and had been driving home late from
selling some produce, when he noticed lights in
the old asylum. He decided to investigate, and
did so. He found the door open, and, penetrating
the place, soon encountered us. He took us
home with him, and helped us clean up a bit,
and then we hastened over here to report."</p>

<p>"And that's true, by gum, every dinged word
uv it!" came a voice outside the open door.
Farmer&mdash;and Constable&mdash;Timmons stepped into
the room, dramatically throwing back his coat and
exposing a big tin star, just as he had seen constables
in rural dramas do.</p>

<p>"But they ain't told it all," he rushed on.
"These two lads here saved my wife frum some
ruffians what wanted ter rob her the t'other day.
They sailed by in their sky-buggy jus' in time ter
save ther spoons thet Gran'ma Timmons willed
me on her dyin' bed, by heck!&mdash;-- and it's my idee
that this same gang of roustabouts was consarned
in thet, frum what I kin judge."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>The officer pressed a button. An orderly responded,
coming smartly to attention.</p>

<p>"Send for Merritt and Chance at once," he
ordered.</p>

<p>The orderly saluted and turned like an automaton.</p>

<p>Constable Timmons gazed at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"Is thet feller real or jes' one uv them clockwork
dummies yer read about?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He's real, constable," smiled Lieutenant De
Frees, with some amusement. He then began
questioning the boys concerning every detail of
their experiences. Nor did he forget to acknowledge
that he had wronged them on the word of a
rascal.</p>

<p>"It must have been their intention to keep you
there until they had made up their minds what
to do with you," he said. "But they shall not
go unpunished. If a summary court martial can
deal with their cases it shall do so, and at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Well?" he added interrogatively, as the orderly
entered the room once more.</p>

<p>He saluted as before, to Constable Timmons'
undisguised wonder, and then said in precise
tones:</p>

<p>"There is no trace of the men you sent for,
sir."</p>

<p>"What!" demanded the officer.</p>

<p>"They were last seen leaving the grounds in
an automobile, sir."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! This is confirmation, indeed,
of their guilt," said the officer. "Were they
alone?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. The car was driven by a person
some of the men recognized as a wandering photographer
who has been around the grounds for
some days, sir."</p>

<p>"Herr Muller!" exclaimed Ned, forgetting all
discipline. "I know now why the third man
seemed so familiar. I&mdash;I beg your pardon, sir,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right, Strong," said the officer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
"Constable, you can rely on the department cooperating
with you in every way to capture these
men. I can't conceive how the photographer
Muller fits into the matter, but if they can be
arrested we shall soon find out."</p>

<p>But, despite the officer's hopes of capturing the
gang that had made so much trouble for Ned
and Herc, they managed to conceal their traces
cleverly enough to avoid arrest. The automobile
in which they had taken flight&mdash;and which
had been hired from a local garage&mdash;was found
abandoned near a small wayside station, where
they might have boarded a train for some distant
point. As for the presence of the automobile,
it was assumed that Herr Muller had visited
the abandoned asylum early that day and discovered
that the prisoners had escaped. Realizing
that he must act quickly, he had evidently
set out at once to warn Chance and Merritt. Incidentally,
it was found out that Muller, on account
of his anarchistic tendencies, had once been confined
in the abandoned asylum, before its condemnation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
which accounted for his familiarity
with it. He had been discharged as "harmless"
some time before.</p>

<p>"Humph! He's about as harmless as a rattlesnake!"
grunted Herc, when he heard of this.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">FLYING FOR A RECORD.</p>


<p>On the day set for the flight to the <i>Manhattan</i>,
which had anchored two days before in the
"Roads," Ned found that he was to be the only
competitor. Herc had been anxious to take part,
and so had several of the other naval aviators,
but Lieutenant De Frees decided that the aeroplane
which Ned was to fly was the only one
really suited for the work.</p>

<p>This aeroplane, which had been equipped with
pontoons, in order to test Ned's invention, presented
a peculiar appearance. Under its substructure,
long, galvanized metal tanks had been
fitted, in much the same way as runners are
attached to a sled. The tanks were cylindrical
in shape, and provided with valves, by means of
which they could be "ballasted." They had been
already tested and found to be suited for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
work for which they were designed. They were
as light as was compatible with safety, and hung
far enough above the ground so as not to interfere
with the landing-wheels.</p>

<p>A holiday from routine practice had been declared
about the aviation testing grounds on the
day of the daring flight. The men hung about
in little groups, discussing Ned's chances of winning
out in the risky feat he meant to perform.
It would be the first time such a thing had ever
been attempted, and they were not slow to give
him full measure of praise for his daring.</p>

<p>The flight was to be more or less of a secret.
Few on board the battleship but the naval board
invited to witness the attempt, knew of the test.
As a consequence, there was nobody about the
grounds but the regular quota of pupils and officers
when, at 10:30 a. m. the <i>Manhattan</i> wirelessed
to the "Field outfit" maintained on the
grounds, that all was in readiness for the trial.</p>

<p>A steel landing platform, made collapsible, so
that it could be instantly stowed away, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
erected on the after deck of the battleship. Ned
knew its approximate position, but the time had
been too brief to allow him to visit the vessel
and make personal observations. But if Ned
realized the risk he ran in thus undertaking a
flight into the practically unknown, he did not
show it. In fact, he was the coolest person on
the field.</p>

<p>At length all was in readiness, and, drawing
on a pair of gauntlets, and adjusting a life-preserver,
Ned stepped up to the aeroplane and
clambered into his seat.</p>

<p>A minute later the roar of the motor, as he
set it going, drowned all other sounds. But the
lad caught above the uproar of the engine Lieutenant
De Frees' shouted farewell:</p>

<p>"Good luck, my boy!"</p>

<p>Ned responded with a wave and a shouted cry:</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>The next instant he waved his hand in token
that he was ready to start. The men holding
the struggling aeroplane released it, and it shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
forward, taking the air within a few feet of the
starting point. It rocketed skyward in a trail
of blue smoke, leaving behind a reek of gasolene
and burning lubricating oil.</p>

<p>Ned directed his course as high as possible,
for he wished thoroughly to inspect the surroundings
before he commenced his attempt. It was
a bright, clear day, almost windless. As he rose
higher, the glorious panorama of the open roadstead
spread before his eyes. On its glistening
surface lay a dark object, like a slumbering leviathan.
Ned knew it in a flash for the anchored
<i>Manhattan</i>&mdash;his goal.</p>

<p>Already a wireless had gone vibrating through
the air announcing his departure, and a dozen
glasses were aimed at the sky from the big fighting
machine. Ned was watched for as eagerly
as if he had been a real aerial enemy.</p>

<p>The lad circled about for a few minutes, making
sure that his motor was working perfectly,
and then he turned his prow toward the distant
warship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Straight toward her he flew, holding his course
as true as a homing pigeon. The wind sang by
his ears, and vibrated in the steel wire rigging
of his sky-clipper as he raced along. The motor's
drone behind him was as steady as a heart
beat.</p>

<p>Ned's eyes shone with the desire of achievement.
He was making a flight which might
have a material effect upon the future armament
of United States war vessels. He realized to the
full the importance of his flight, and how much
depended on it.</p>

<p>All at once his practiced eye detected, on the
mirror-like surface of the stretch of water beneath
him, a slight ruffle. It was some distance
off. But Ned knew it spelled only one thing:</p>

<p>Wind!</p>

<p>"Bother it all," he thought, "just like the luck.
However, it will only be a squall, I imagine."</p>

<p>He braced himself for a battle with the airman's
greatest enemy. In a few seconds the
squall was upon him. For an instant the aeroplane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
hesitated and thrilled like a live thing. Ned
applied more power. Like a horse under the
whip, his aeroplane shot forward. Every bolt
and rivet in it strained and creaked under the
tension. Ned was doing a daring thing in bucking
the wind and fighting with it, instead of
jockeying for some advantage.</p>

<p>But then Ned had a fighting nature in the best
sense. An obstacle only aroused him to fresh
effort. "Obstacles are things made to be conquered,"
he said, with another famous battler,
whose name lives in history.</p>

<p>Zee-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e!</p>

<p>The wind screamed and tore about him, while
below, the water was lashed into white-caps.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz!" exclaimed Ned to himself. "If
anything parts, I'm due to test out the floating
abilities of the pontoons sooner than I expected."</p>

<p>But, although sadly racked and strained, the
aeroplane, under her operator's skilful handling,
weathered the squall. Ned turned his head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
watched it go whistling and howling shoreward,
with deep satisfaction.</p>

<p>"A fine end to the test it would have been," he
muttered, "if I'd been dumped in the sea by a
squall at the outset."</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was maneuvering above
the big Dreadnought. The vessel looked queer
and dwarfed from the height at which he hovered.
But Ned could not help thinking what a
fine object she would offer for an aerial marksman.
As the lad knew, there is a limit to the
perpendicular aiming of a gun, and skimming
directly above the vessel, as he was, it was doubtful
if the most skilful gunner on board could
have hit his aeroplane.</p>

<p>At the stern of the big ship, the young aviator
now noticed a platform&mdash;evidently the one
on which he was expected to land. His heart
gave a thump, as he gazed down on it.</p>

<p>"It doesn't look much bigger than a checkerboard,"
he thought, "and if I don't hit it&mdash;wow!
as Herc would say."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>As carefully and coolly as if he were on a
practice flight, Ned regulated his levers. Then,
with a quick intake of his breath, he darted downward.</p>

<p>Down&mdash;down, he shot, the blood singing in
his ears with the rapidity of his descent. It was
thrilling, desperate&mdash;dangerous!</p>

<p>Suddenly, as Ned placed his foot on a pedal
and applied a warping appliance, there was a
sharp "crack!"</p>

<p>The aeroplane hesitated for an instant.</p>

<p>Then, without the slightest warning, it lurched
in sickening fashion, almost unseating him.</p>

<p>The next instant Ned was hurtling downward
through space like a plummet. Disaster, swift
and certain, rushed up to meet him from the steel
fighting machine beneath.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DROP FROM SPACE.</p>


<p>But even in that awful drop through space
Ned's nerve did not desert him. His brain
worked faster, in the few seconds allowed it to
do effective work, than it had ever acted before.</p>

<p>Just as it seemed to those on board the battleship
that the lad was doomed&mdash;in the event of
the pontoons not working&mdash;to be drowned in the
wreck of the aeroplane, they were astonished to
see it recover and rise, from the very wave tips,
in a graceful curve.</p>

<p>Straight up it shot&mdash;the motor whirring and
buzzing deafeningly. Then, without an instant's
hesitation, it dropped like a fish hawk toward the
stern platform, and a moment later Ned Strong
and his aeroplane rested on the solid foundation
of the landing stage. The first flight from land
to a fighting ship's deck had been successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
performed, with an added thrill thrown in for
good measure, as it were.</p>

<p>Before Ned could clamber out of his seat, the
officers, assembled to view the test, came crowding
up on the platform. The lad was not embarrassed,
but he felt a slight sense of shyness,
which speedily wore off, as so many dignitaries
pressed about him, shaking his hand and congratulating
him.</p>

<p>"Jove, lad, but you gave us a fright for a
minute!" exclaimed one gray-mustached captain.
"I didn't think it possible that a heavier-than-air
craft could recover from such a tumble as you
took."</p>

<p>"Yes, tell us about it, lad," urged another naval
dignitary.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said Ned, "I guess it was
just one of those accidents that will happen in
the best-regulated aeroplanes. Something went
wrong with the warping appliances, that was
all."</p>

<p>"Aren't your nerves shaken?" asked a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
officer. "You'd better have a glass of wine."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, I never touch alcoholic
liquors," rejoined Ned simply. "But I wouldn't
mind a glass of water, sir. Flying is rather
thirsty work."</p>

<p>An orderly was at once dispatched for a carafe
and a glass, and while he was gone Ned obtained
leave to locate and repair the break that had
come so close to causing him disaster. It was
soon found, and a new turnbuckle put on in
place of the one that had cracked when a flaw in
its construction parted.</p>

<p>By this time every jackie who could find business
in the after part of the ship was on the
decks below. A sea of faces was upturned to
gaze at the flying marvel.</p>

<p>Questions flew thick and fast.</p>

<p>"Would it be possible to carry a sharpshooter,
for instance, from the deck of this vessel, circle
a hostile craft and return?" asked one of the
naval officers standing about.</p>

<p>"I think so, sir," was Ned's response.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, providing you feel there is no danger,
why not try such an experiment?" asked Commander
Dunham, Ned's old chief officer.</p>

<p>"I should like to, above all things, sir," rejoined
Ned, with sparkling eyes; "but who will
go?"</p>

<p>"I think you will have no lack of volunteers,"
smiled Commander Dunham, as half a dozen
young ensigns and midshipmen pressed forward.
"Mr. Shrike, I think you are as good a subject
as any. At any rate, sir, your weight will not
seriously embarrass the craft."</p>

<p>Mr. Shrike proved to be an extremely thin
young midshipman, whose weight, as Commander
Dunham had humorously hinted, was not
excessive. In fact, among his intimates he was
known as "The Shrimp."</p>

<p>He lost no time in preparing for the ride, providing
himself with a light rifle. When all was
in readiness, Ned showed him where to sit, and
how to hold on, and then, the aeroplane having
already been swung about, he started up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
engine once more. Several blue-jackets had been
detailed to hold the machine back, and at a given
signal from Ned they let go. The aeroplane
shot from the platform out over the stern of the
battleship, and soared out above the sea. As they
shot past Old Glory, waving proudly at the stern,
Ned saluted with one hand. The young middy
at his side followed his example.</p>

<p>The aeroplane took a perilous swoop as she
dropped from the platform, but Ned had his
craft well in hand. He averted the drop with a
quick movement and speedily swung out seaward.</p>

<p>"See, there is a small sloop off there," said
Midshipman Shrike presently. "Let's try if we
can circle it, just as if it were a hostile vessel."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," rejoined Ned, and steered
straight for a white sail glistening some distance
out at sea.</p>

<p>Closer and closer they drew to it, and before
long they could see men on its deck pointing upward
excitedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"They've seen us, anyway," laughed the middy.
"Wonder if they think we're some big sort of a
gull?"</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they drew closer to the sloop,
Ned saw one of the men go in the cabin for a
moment and emerge with a gun&mdash;or at least
something that looked like one.</p>

<p>"Hullo! What's that fellow doing now?"
asked Midshipman Shrike, as he saw this. "Is
that a gun he has there, Strong?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it, sir," rejoined Ned, "and
he's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aiming at us, by Jove! Hi, there, you rascal,
put that gun down!"</p>

<p>A puff of smoke came simultaneously with
the words. It was followed by a screaming
sound, as a bullet whizzed past the aerial voyagers.
It was followed by another and another,
the rifle evidently being a repeater.</p>

<p>"I say, I can't stand this any longer," shrilled
the middy, as Ned kept the aeroplane swinging
in rapid circles. As he spoke, he jerked the rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
to his shoulder, and, with a cry of "Stop that
shooting instantly!" fired a shot across the
sloop's bow. Ned could see the white water
whipped up as the bullet ricochetted.</p>

<p>But, in firing his weapon, the young officer
had released his hold with both hands. At the
same instant a puff of wind swung the aeroplane
sharply on her beam ends. Ned righted her instantly,
but, as he did so, he was horrified to
observe that he was alone.</p>

<p>The sharp lurch had dislodged his companion,
and below Ned saw him whirling downward.
The midshipman's body struck the water close
by the sloop and instantly vanished.</p>

<p>With the automatic movements of one in a
nightmare, Ned dropped downward. As he did
so, he was immensely relieved to see the young
officer's head bob up to the surface for an instant.
Ned shouted and an answering hail came
upward.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven, I've got the pontoons on," he
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>But even while his mind and body were thus
busied, Ned had time to observe the sloop. She
had taken advantage of the puff of wind, and
was now rapidly slipping off toward a not far distant
point of land. Ned's eye took in her every
detail. She was black and squat, yet with a
certain raciness of line, and heavily canvassed.
Round her bulwarks ran a bright crimson line.
She bore no name that Ned could see.</p>

<p>The aeroplane struck the water with a splash
that threw the spray high above her planes. But
the pontoons saved her from being submerged.
A moment after she had struck the surface of
the water she was floating like a sea-bird on its
surface.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, there!" came a hail.</p>

<p>Ned glanced in the direction and saw the
young middy striking out boldly for the floating
aeroplane.</p>

<p>"Hurt, sir?" demanded Ned.</p>

<p>"Not a bit; the water's fine," was the cheery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
response. "But, confound it all, I've lost my
rifle."</p>

<p>Ned swung the aeroplane round, using the
regular aerial propellers to drive her over the
water. It was not many minutes before a dripping
but cheerful middy was seated once more
by his side.</p>

<p>"I say, Strong," he remarked, "I guess the less
said about this adventure the better. You understand.
I had no business to fire at those
chaps on the sloop, as a matter of fact, but I
couldn't help it. What do you think they fired at
us for?"</p>

<p>"I've no idea, sir," was Ned's reply.</p>

<p>"Guess they were crazy, or had been drinking,
or something."</p>

<p>"Possibly that was it, Mr. Shrike." But in
the Dreadnought Boy's mind he had reached a
far different conclusion. The shots that whistled
about them had not been aimed by any irresponsible
hand, of that he was sure. They had been
aimed to do harm. That they had not succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
was due to good fortune more than anything
else. There were only certain men whom Ned
could think of who could be guilty of such an
outrage. Those men were the implacable
enemies of himself and Herc.</p>

<p>"Better cruise about a bit till I get dried out,"
said the middy presently. "If they ask us why
we dropped like that, I'll say we were trying out
the pontoons, eh?"</p>

<p>Ned agreed. He did not countenance untruths
or an approach to them, as a rule, but in this case
he felt that to tell the whole story might get
Midshipman Shrike in trouble, as well as involve
him in some difficulties. However, he resolved
that if questions were asked, he would tell the
truth, as he would then have no other recourse.
But, to his relief, no interrogations were put to
him, and he supposed that the midshipman had
explained the case, as was, indeed, the fact.</p>

<p>Soon after their return, Ned winged back to
the shore. Here he was the recipient of more
congratulations, but his mind was busy elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
than with his signal triumph in aerial navigation.
As soon as he got a chance, he sought
out Herc. The astonishment of the freckle-faced
Dreadnought Boy, on hearing the news, may be
imagined.</p>

<p>"Then you are sure that it was Muller and
that crowd?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Practically certain," rejoined Ned. "Who
else would have done such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Do you think they have some rendezvous in
the neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it. Their possession of the sloop
indicates that. I'd like to unearth their hiding-place
and put the rascals to rout."</p>

<p>"So would I," agreed Herc, "and maybe we
will. At any rate, that sloop should be easy to
identify."</p>

<p>"Yes. We'll keep a bright lookout, and perhaps
before long we may have something tangible
to work on."</p>

<p>That time was to come sooner than they expected.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE SETTING OF A TRAP.</p>


<p>"I've just received a telegram that a freight
wreck has tied up our new motors and spare
aeroplane parts at Bartonville," said Lieutenant
De Frees, one afternoon a few days after Ned's
adventures with the pontoon-fitted aeroplane.</p>

<p>"Most annoying," responded the ensign with
whom he was talking. "We need them in a
hurry, too."</p>

<p>"That's so. I guess I'll have to send a couple
of men after them. There is a big auto truck
at Bartonville. I remember it, because it brought
out some stuff for us before. It can easily carry
the delayed parts. Strong and Taylor have been
working pretty hard lately. I guess a little trip
will do them good. I'll send them. At any rate,
I'll know I can depend upon them."</p>

<p>"That's right. They are two of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
promising lads I've ever seen. By the way, has
anything further ever been heard of those rascals
who tried to discredit them?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. But the secret service reports
that this man Muller, as he calls himself, is
known in Europe as a most dangerous anarchist.
The fellow is, in fact, a maniac on the subject."</p>

<p>"Ha! I suppose we can call ourselves lucky
that he didn't blow us all up. Those anarchist
chaps are bitterly opposed to all navies and armies,
and some of the worst of them have even
attempted to destroy transatlantic liners."</p>

<p>"Yes, I read in the paper the other day about
an infernal machine having been found among
the cargo of a large vessel just as she was about
to sail for Europe. By the way, of course you
heard about the clever manner in which Strong
and Taylor prevented the destruction of the submarine?"</p>

<p>"I did hear something about it, but not the
full story, I fancy. Would you mind telling it?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. But first let me send for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Strong and Taylor. I'll despatch them on their
errand at once. They will have to get a rig and
drive over. Bartonville is ten miles away, and
they may experience some delay when they arrive
there."</p>

<p>Thus it came about that that afternoon Ned
and Herc found themselves in Bartonville, registered
as guests at the Bartonville House. As
the lieutenant had anticipated, they experienced
some delay in getting permission to transship the
goods from the delayed freight train. But the
magic word "Navy" soon smoothed out all obstacles.
It would be necessary for them to wait
till the following day, however, before finishing
up their business. Ned's first duty was to send a
telegram to Lieutenant De Frees to that effect.
In return he received orders for both Herc and
himself to remain and see the business through.</p>

<p>"Well," grinned Herc, as the two lads sat in
the lobby of the hotel in soft leather-upholstered
chairs, "this is certainly solid comfort for a pair
of petty officers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a long cry from here to the forecastle
of the <i>Manhattan</i>, and that's a fact," admitted
Ned. "But somehow I'd rather be on duty than
lounging around here."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother duty," blurted out Herc, "when
first we entered the navy, it was always duty&mdash;although
that duty was mostly scrubbing decks,
painting and cleaning brasswork. And now it's
duty still, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So it will be to the end, old fellow," said
Ned seriously. "Everyone in the navy has his
duty to attend to, too. Wasn't it attention to duty
that won Manila Bay, and duty that took Farragut&mdash;&mdash; Great
Scott!"</p>

<p>The lads had been sitting facing the street
near a big plate glass window. The sight that
had brought Ned to his feet with such a sharp
exclamation was the momentary glimpse of a
familiar face passing on the street.</p>

<p>"Wait here for me for a while, Herc," he said.
"I'll be back directly."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;why?" spluttered Herc, but before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
he could voice any more interrogations, Ned
dashed from the room with the swiftness of a
skyrocket, and, jamming his hat on his head, was
out of the doors of the hotel in a flash, almost
upsetting the porter in his haste. Herc sprang
after him, but before he gained the doorway Ned
was round the corner and hopelessly lost. Herc
retraced his steps to the hotel and resumed his
seat.</p>

<p>It was something like an hour later that he
heard his name called through the lobby by a
bell-boy. He hastened to the desk and the clerk
motioned toward an ill-kempt looking man who
was standing there.</p>

<p>"Mr. Taylor?" asked this individual.</p>

<p>"That's me," responded the rough-and-ready
Herc, with a grin.</p>

<p>"I've a message for you from Mr. Strong,"
went on the other. "He wishes you to come to
him at once."</p>

<p>Herc's suspicions were aroused in an instant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Perhaps this was a trap of some sort. He resolved
to be cautious.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" he asked.</p>

<p>The man beckoned him to one side.</p>

<p>"I don't want everybody to hear our business,"
he said. "Your chum has succeeded in locating
that rascally band of Muller's. They are at a
place on the outside of the town. You and I
will go to him in a hack, that was his message."</p>

<p>The man seemed sincere, but Herc was still
inclined to doubt him.</p>

<p>"Where did you meet my shipmate?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, I'm a fisherman on the headwaters of
the bay that runs up into Bartonville," was the
rejoinder, with every appearance of frankness.
"Your chum didn't want to leave the place where
he had spotted the band, so he sent me after you
and told me that you'd give me some money for
my trouble."</p>

<p>This request for money lulled Herc's suspicions
at once. Had the man not asked for it,
the thing might have looked suspicious, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
fact that he expected to be rewarded for coming
with the message seemed to indicate that he was
honest and above board. But he had one more
question to ask.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be a good plan to notify the
police?" he said.</p>

<p>"He told me to do that," replied the man. "I
stopped in at the station on the way up, and a
patrol-wagon full of cops has started. We'll
have to go fast to catch them."</p>

<p>Herc searched his pockets. But, as luck would
have it, he could not find more than a few bits
of silver. But the boys on their arrival had
deposited in the hotel safe the money entrusted
to them to pay their expenses, and also to defray
the charges on the freighted goods. Herc recollected
this, and thinking that it might be a good
plan to have some money along, he withdrew a
considerable part of their funds. Had he caught
the glitter in the man's eyes, he would have been
warned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, I'm ready," he said, as he thrust the
money into his breast pocket.</p>

<p>"All right, guv'ner," was the response, "the
carriage is right outside."</p>

<p>Herc, following his conductor, soon found himself
inside a closed hack drawn by two horses.
The messenger said something to the coachman
and then threw himself in beside Herc. The
carriage at once moved off at a rapid pace. Bartonville
was not a very large place, and the town
and its scattering outskirts were speedily left
behind. The carriage began to roll and bump
along over country roads.</p>

<p>"How far off is the place?" Herc kept asking,
and each time he was assured that it was "only
a little way further."</p>

<p>At last the carriage stopped on a deserted bit
of roadway.</p>

<p>"Here's where we get out," said Herc's conductor,
"we'll have to hike it across that field and
through that bit of woods before we get to your
pal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Herc paid the coachman and the man at once
drove off.</p>

<p>"This way," said the man, climbing over a
rail fence and striking off across a field, on the
further side of which was a patch of ragged
woods. Through the trees Herc could catch the
glint of water.</p>

<p>It was a lonely spot. He looked about him,
but could not see any trace of a human habitation.</p>

<p>"If this should be a trap I'm nicely in it, all
right," he muttered to himself as he followed his
guide into the shadows of the wood.</p>

<p>"How much further?" he asked, as they stumbled
along over the rough path.</p>

<p>"Right ahead down by the creek," said the
man. "We're almost there now."</p>

<p>With a few paces more they emerged on the
banks of a slow-flowing and muddy creek, which
was evidently tidal and joined the Bartonville
Bay lower down. About a hundred yards off
stood a rickety looking shack, and anchored in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the creek opposite to it was a sloop with a red
band painted round its bulwarks. Suddenly and
for no reason that he could assign, the recollection
flashed across Herc that he had heard Ned
speak of such a sloop. At the time though he
could not recall in what connection.</p>

<p>"Is this the place?" asked Herc, as his guide
slackened his pace.</p>

<p>"This is it," nodded the man, and again a
sharp presentiment that all was not right, flashed
through Herc. But it was too late to hold back
now.</p>

<p>"I'll give him the signal," said the man, placing
his fingers to his lips. A shrill whistle followed.</p>

<p>As if by magic, from the tall, spiky grass
about them, half a dozen men sprang erect.</p>

<p>"It is a trap!" shouted Herc, flinging himself
furiously upon the first man who rushed at him.
The lad fought valiantly, but the contest was too
uneven to last long. Within five minutes, Herc,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
raging like a lion, and inwardly abusing his own
gullibility that had led him into such an ambush,
was bound hand and foot and stretched a prisoner
on the floor of the old rookery of a shanty.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE SPRINGING THEREOF.</p>


<p>The rude hut, which, judging by its odor and
condition, was used as an occasional shelter for
the bay fishermen, was full of talk and smoke.
Herc could not catch much meaning from the
confused babel of tongues, but judged from the
intelligible snatches he could seize upon, that it
related to himself and Ned.</p>

<p>He was hardly surprised to recognize, among
the occupants of the place, Chance and Merritt,
as well as Herr Muller. There were four or five
other men, including the one who had led him
into the trap.</p>

<p>Herc's keen eyes also noticed one peculiarity
about each of the men about him. Every one
of them wore in his buttonhole a tiny strip of
bright red ribbon. What its significance might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
be, he had no way of telling, of course, but it
impressed him.</p>

<p>"Well," said Herr Muller at last, his voice
rising masterfully above those of the rest, "we
had better be getting on board. The tide is on
the turn, and we have much to do. Besides, they
may pursue us from the town."</p>

<p>"No chance of that, comrade," rejoined the
man who had conducted Herc from Bartonville.
"I got the lad away without any one noticing our
departure."</p>

<p>"Just the same, both those Dreadnought Boys
are tricky as cats," snarled Merritt. "My advice
is to get away at once."</p>

<p>A general bustle followed. Herc was lifted
bodily, and carried down a narrow plank gangway
leading to the sloop. Once on board, he was
half-thrown, half-pushed, into a stuffy cabin,
and the door above him closed with a sharp bang.
He heard a metallic clang, as the bolts and lock,
which evidently held it, were closed.</p>

<p>"Wow!" exclaimed the Dreadnought Boy. "If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
this isn't what old Ben Franklin would call 'the
logical limit of the uttermost.'"</p>

<p>The cabin was almost dark, being lighted only
by two dirty and very small port holes. It was,
moreover, stuffy and malodorous. Herc tried to
get on his feet, but, being bound hand and foot,
he was compelled to lie as he had fallen at the
foot of the stairs. On deck he could hear the
trampling of feet, and before long the motion of
the sloop told him that she was under way.</p>

<p>"Going to sea, I guess," mused Herc. "I wonder
what they mean to do with me?"</p>

<p>He was left to speculate on this topic for some
time. The motion of a choppy sea was already
manifest when a man descended into the cabin
with some bread and some cold meat. He also
had a stone jug presumably containing water.</p>

<p>"Here you are," he said, thrusting it in front
of Herc. "You'd better eat while you get a
chance."</p>

<p>"I can't do that very well while I'm all trussed
up like a roasting chicken," objected Herc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's so," assented the man. "Well, I guess
there's no harm in setting you loose for a while.
We've cleared the bay, and the only place you
can go to if you want to get away is overboard."</p>

<p>So saying, he loosened Herc's bonds, to the
immense satisfaction of the freckle-faced boy.</p>

<p>The man seemed to be a shade less rough than
his companions, so Herc ventured to ask him a
question.</p>

<p>"What is the occasion for all this?" he inquired
in a half-humorous tone.</p>

<p>"Now, don't ask questions, and you won't hear
untruths," said the man.</p>

<p>With this, he hastened out of the cabin, carefully
relocking the companionway door on the
outside.</p>

<p>"Wow!" exclaimed Herc, giving vent to his
favorite exclamation. Then he fell to eating
with a will.</p>

<p>The meal, coarse as it was, revived his spirits.
It was only when he came to taste the water that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
he put it down with a wry face. It was bitter,
and had a nauseating flavor.</p>

<p>"I'm not certain," mused Herc, "but nevertheless,
I'm pretty sure that some sort of drug has
been placed in that stuff. Too bad. I'm thirsty
enough to drink it all, too."</p>

<p>The motion of the sloop was quite lively now.
It was evident that they were some distance out
at sea. Occasionally, too, a green wave, washing
over one of the port-holes, partially obscured
what little light there was.</p>

<p>"Guess I might as well explore the place and
see what sort of a craft this is," said Herc, as inactivity
grew irksome. He started up from the
locker on which he had been sitting, and made
toward a door at the stern of the cabin.</p>

<p>It was not locked, and the lad threw it open
without effort. What was his astonishment to
see, stretched on a bunk, apparently in deep slumber,
the form of his missing comrade.</p>

<p>"Ned! Ned!" exclaimed Herc, springing forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Usually Ned, as sailors say, "slept with one
eye open." This was a quality he shared with
most seamen.</p>

<p>Herc was heartily astonished, therefore, to
find that his shipmate did not respond at once to
his vigorous shakings and shoutings. At length
however, he bestirred himself, and yawned, moving
in an inert fashion, much unlike his usual
movements, which were full of activity and life.</p>

<p>"Oh-ho! Hi-hum!" he yawned, gaping
broadly, and gazing about him. "What's up,
watch turning out?"</p>

<p>"Wish it was, and that we were safe back on
the old <i>Manhattan</i>," muttered Herc.</p>

<p>"No, my hearty," he went on, "the watch isn't
being turned out; but it's time you woke up, just
the same. It's my opinion that you've been
drugged with some of that stuff they tried to
give me."</p>

<p>After renewed efforts, Herc finally succeeded
in getting Ned broad awake. But it was some
minutes before his befogged brain took in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
situation. As Herc had suspected, he had been
drugged by some substance placed in a drink of
water he had asked for.</p>

<p>Ned, once restored to himself, speedily explained
how it was the sight of Kennell passing
the hotel that had caused him to make his hasty
exit, and indirectly bring about the present situation.</p>

<p>He had followed Kennell through the outskirts
of the town, he said, wishing to find out where
he was going. He succeeded in this beyond his
hopes, but Kennell, it appeared subsequently, had
been aware that Ned was following him, from
the moment the Dreadnought Boy had left the
hotel. Cunningly he had led him right up to
the lone fisher hut, and Ned's capture had been
swift and easy for the nefarious band.</p>

<p>Herc's story followed.</p>

<p>"There's something mysterious about the
band," he said. "Take that bit of ribbon they
wear, for instance&mdash;what is it? What does it
signify?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heard enough of their talk before I drank
the drugged water to apprise me of that," said
Ned. "These fellows are a bunch of desperate
anarchists. They are acting, as far as I can
make out, in the interests of some European
power, and mean to do all the harm they can to
Uncle Sam's navy."</p>

<p>"The despicable scoundrels!" gasped Herc.
"But how did Chance and Merritt come to join
them?"</p>

<p>"Money, I suppose. They seem to be well supplied.
I guess Chance and Merritt are being well
paid for the information they can impart to the
rascals concerning the secrets of our naval organization."</p>

<p>"Do you think it is possible they could be such
traitors?"</p>

<p>"Anything is possible where they are concerned.
By the way, Herc, this is no ordinary
sloop we are on. In the first place, it is the same
craft as that from which I was fired on at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
time Midshipman Shrike fell from the aeroplane."</p>

<p>Herc nodded.</p>

<p>"Now I know why that red stripe seemed so
familiar," he said.</p>

<p>"Moreover," resumed Ned, "she is fitted with
wireless."</p>

<p>"With wireless!"</p>

<p>"Yes. The instruments are in another cabin
forward of this one. I noticed the aerial wires
on her mast, too, as I was brought on board.
Muller ordered them hauled down, but not before
I had seen them."</p>

<p>"What does she want with a wireless apparatus?"</p>

<p>"I can't imagine, unless it is to catch the messages
that the ships of the navy are sending concerning
plans, and so on."</p>

<p>"But they are in cipher."</p>

<p>"Yes, but there are two men on board who
know that cipher&mdash;Chance and Merritt. That
fact alone explains their value to the anarchists."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph! That's so," agreed Herc. "But
what's the matter with our looking about a bit
more? We might discover something else."</p>

<p>"All right. My head still aches a little, but
otherwise I'm well enough," responded Ned. "I
guess we are safe from interruption for a time.
The wind seems to be freshening, and the men
will all be busy on deck. I reckon they think we
are both drugged, too, and are safe not to
awaken for some time."</p>

<p>"Wow! I'm glad I didn't drink that water, or
there would be more truth than poetry in that,"
said Herc.</p>

<p>"I guess they gave me a light dose, for I didn't
taste it," said Ned.</p>

<p>"Good thing they did, or I couldn't have
roused you so easily."</p>

<p>The two boys cautiously set about exploring
the cabin. It was a bare little place, and did not
contain much subject matter for investigation.
There was a door forward leading to the wireless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
room, but it was locked. Ned listened at
the keyhole, but the instruments were silent.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Herc, suddenly halting and
pointing downward at the cabin floor. "What's
under here, I wonder?"</p>

<p>There was a ring at his feet. Ned lost no
time in laying hold of it. He gave it a sharp
tug, and it came up easily, bringing with it a
section of flooring to which it had been attached.</p>

<p>It revealed a dark, yawning space under the
cabin floor, into which both boys peered eagerly.</p>

<p>"There's something in there, but I can't make
out what," said Ned presently. "Wait a jiffy,
till I strike a match."</p>

<p>A lucifer was soon lighted, and Ned, bending
over, held it inside the hole in the cabin floor.
He recoiled with a jump and a suppressed cry, as
if he had suddenly discovered a nest of rattlesnakes.</p>

<p>"What's up?" demanded Herc, who had been
able to detect nothing but a metallic glitter, like
that of steel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Torpedoes!" gasped Ned; "six Whiteheads!
enough to destroy all the finest and newest vessels
of Uncle Sam's navy."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ON BOARD THE SLOOP.</p>


<p>They had no further opportunity, just then,
to comment on their discovery. For, just as Ned
voiced it, somebody could be heard fumbling
with the lock on the companionway door. It
was the work of an instant for Herc to replace
the removable section of the flooring while Ned
slid silently and swiftly back into the cabin he
had vacated.</p>

<p>Herc had just time to resume his seat on the
locker, together with a vacant expression of
countenance, when the door was flung open. It
admitted a gust of fresh, crisp air and a shower
of spray.</p>

<p>"Wish I was up on deck inhaling some of
that," commented Herc to himself, as he turned
his head to see who the newcomer might be.</p>

<p>It proved to be Herr Muller. He came down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the steps slowly, glancing about him sharply as
he came. He seemed somewhat surprised as his
eyes lit on Herc perched up on his locker.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! awake!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You hadn't any reason to suppose I'd be
asleep, had you?" inquired Herc blandly.</p>

<p>"No. You boys are too wide-awake altogether.
That is why we have taken you off on this
cruise," chuckled the anarchist grimly.</p>

<p>"Very considerate of you, I'm sure," rejoined
Herc. "And this&mdash;this cruise, I presume, it isn't
for our health?"</p>

<p>"Hardly," rejoined the other, with a smile;
"I mean to make you useful to us and&mdash;to the
cause!"</p>

<p>His eyes glittered as he spoke. The glare of
a fanatic filled them.</p>

<p>"How is your comrade?" he asked the next
instant.</p>

<p>Herc saw the trap instantly. Muller had
thought to trap him into answering without
thought. Had he done so, the crafty anarchist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
would have known that the boys had been talking
together. So Herc assumed his most unworldly
expression.</p>

<p>"What, is Ned on board?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You didn't know it?"</p>

<p>"Not I. You are clever fellows to have
trapped both of us."</p>

<p>Herr Muller looked at the lad sharply. He
did not know what to make of this careless, debonair
manner.</p>

<p>"Well, as you observed," he said at length,
"we have trapped you."</p>

<p>"But what for? What do you want with little
us?" grinned Herc.</p>

<p>"You are making fun of me, Mister Yankee."</p>

<p>"Not any more fun than you make of yourself,"
parried Herc quickly.</p>

<p>Herr Muller looked more puzzled than ever.
Then he frowned suddenly. "You do not seem
to realize the seriousness of your position," he
said.</p>

<p>"Not I. Oh, I'm a care-free sail-o-r-r-r-r oh!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
sang Herc. "How do you like my singing?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"Not very much," replied the other, looking at
him with the same puzzled expression. Herr
Muller couldn't make out whether Herc was
crazy or simply light-headed.</p>

<p>"Sorry you don't like it," rejoined Herc; "when
I sing in big cities it brings crowds. Sometimes
it brings the police."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder. But I did not come down
here to talk nonsense. Where is your companion?"</p>

<p>"I told you before I didn't know," rejoined
Herc, seemingly with all the carelessness in the
world. For the second time the crafty foreign
anarchist had failed to trap Herc into an admission
that he and Ned had met.</p>

<p>"I'll go and get him," said Herr Muller, starting
for the cabin.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd bring me a glass of water," said
Herc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is water in that stone jug," said Herr
Muller, indicating the drugged receptacle.</p>

<p>"Oh, I drank all that a long time ago," rejoined
Herc, "I'm very fond of water."</p>

<p>For a reason we know of, Herr Muller looked
surprised.</p>

<p>"You drank <i>all</i> that water!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Sure," rejoined Herc.</p>

<p>"Our water supply has run rather low," said
Herr Muller, watching the Dreadnought Boy
narrowly, "did you notice anything peculiar
about that water?"</p>

<p>"Ah, now you come to speak of it, I did notice
a peculiar taste to it," said Herc, restraining a
desire to chuckle at the other's amazement, "a
sort of bitter flavor. Is it that which you refer
to?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But&mdash;but didn't it make you
sleepy?" queried the other, his curiosity overcoming
his discretion.</p>

<p>"Never felt more wide awake in my life," responded
Herc, "I could sing this instant. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>But Herr Muller had fled into Ned's cabin.
He found the boy apparently just wakening from
a sound slumber, although Ned had enjoyed
every word of Herc's foolish banter.</p>

<p>"Ah, so you are awake at last, Mister Sailor,"
said Herr Muller; "may I trouble you to come
into the other cabin? I have business of importance
to discuss."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Ned shortly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just this: that I have no business to discuss
with a scoundrel."</p>

<p>The reply was like the crack of a whip. The
other grew livid.</p>

<p>"Be careful how you speak," he said, striving
to retain control of himself, "I am not accustomed
to being made game of by whipper-snappers."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" asked Ned, feeling
that, after all, he might learn something by
pretending to fall in with the rascal's plans,
whatever they might prove to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you are willing to talk business with
us?"</p>

<p>"That depends," rejoined Ned, "on whether
it's profitable business. But I warn you," he
went on, raising his voice, "my comrade and I
want to be paid in full and well, too, for anything
we do."</p>

<p>Herc in the outer cabin heard the heightened
tones.</p>

<p>"What's Ned up to now?" he wondered to
himself, "I'll bet he's hit on some plan. I guess
that whatever he says I'll follow his lead. I
don't like playing at being a traitor, though, just
the same."</p>

<p>Herr Muller and Ned now emerged into the
outer cabin.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said the anarchist, pointing to a
place beside Herc. Both boys instantly simulated
great delight and surprise at seeing each
other. Herr Muller looked on somewhat glumly.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they are making fools of me,"
he thought. "They are both sharp as steel traps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
as they say in this country. It is possible. Well,
I shall govern myself accordingly and watch
them closely."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ned, when the first apparently
warm greetings were over, "what is it you want
us to do?"</p>

<p>"Just this," said Herr Muller, "you are a good
mechanic and a fair draughtsman. I want you
to draw me a sectional design of the <i>Manhattan</i>.
When that is done I've got other work for you
to do."</p>

<p>"A design of the <i>Manhattan</i>?" repeated Ned
slowly as if he had not quite understood. He
was in reality trying to gain time to think.</p>

<p>"Yes. You are familiar with her, and I believe
she is the finest ship of your navy."</p>

<p>"I can say 'yes,' to both questions," rejoined
Ned. "What would you want this drawing to
show?"</p>

<p>"For one thing, I should like to know where
her armor is thinnest," was the rejoinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Herr Muller's eyes narrowed as he spoke, and
he gazed sharply at the lad before him.</p>

<p>"You understand?" he asked, as Ned did not
reply.</p>

<p>"Perfectly. I was just trying to collect my
thoughts. So you want a sectional plan of the
<i>Manhattan</i>, showing where her armor is thinnest,"
he said slowly. "Well, supposing I make
one, what is there in it for me?"</p>

<p>"That depends on the success of the grand
project," was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>Ned looked puzzled. Into the anarchist's eyes
there had come the same glare of fanatical fire
that Herc had noted there before.</p>

<p>"What is this grand project, if I may ask?"
he said presently.</p>

<p>"You may ask," was the reply, "but I shall not
answer. The accomplishment itself shall be your
reply&mdash;and the world's."</p>

<p>The man had risen to his feet and was pacing
up and down the cabin excitedly. Suddenly he
turned sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall ask for your reply in half an hour,"
he said abruptly, and plunged, rather than
mounted, up the cabin stairs.</p>

<p>Ned sat lost in thought after his departure.
After a long period of speechlessness, Herc
spoke.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about, Ned?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to put two and two together," said
Ned softly. "If I'm right in my conclusions, this
fellow Muller is one of the most diabolical scoundrels
that ever encumbered the face of the earth."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"BY WIRELESS!"</p>


<p>"Ye-es," drawled Herc judicially, "even without
putting two and two together, I must say
that I agree with you. But what particular
brand of mischief is he up to now, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place, he doesn't want the
plans of the <i>Manhattan</i> just because of his interest
in naval architecture."</p>

<p>"No, hardly. But it gets me what he does
want them for."</p>

<p>"I've formed a pretty definite idea," rejoined
Ned. "It was those torpedoes that set me thinking.
Herc, I believe that a gigantic plot to injure
the American navy is on foot. Those torpedoes
are aboard to be used in pursuance of
that purpose."</p>

<p>"Jiminy crickets!" yelled Herc, fairly brought
to his feet; "and you talk about it as calmly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
if you were asking me to come and have an ice-cream
soda. By the same token, if I don't get
something to drink pretty soon I'll dry up and
wither away."</p>

<p>"We've got to keep calm," rejoined Ned.
"Getting excited won't do any good. Look here,
Herc, have you anything in the shape of a
wrench about you?"</p>

<p>"I've got that small one I use on the motor of
my aeroplane."</p>

<p>"Not any too big," commented Ned. "But it'll
have to do. Now, Herc, you watch the stairway
while I get busy."</p>

<p>"If any one comes down, shall I tackle them?"
asked the freckle-faced youth, who was always
ready for a rough-and-tumble.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, no! To arouse their suspicions
that we are anything but friendly to them
would never do. Just tell me if you hear any one
fumbling with the door."</p>

<p>"All right," said Herc, taking up his position
at the foot of the stairway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned at once yanked up the section of flooring
operated by the ring. By dint of wriggling and
twisting, he managed to work himself down into
the compartment containing the deadly implements.
Then he set to work with his wrench.</p>

<p>The task kept him busy for half an hour or
more. When he finally emerged from his
cramped quarters into the cabin, he carried something
very carefully wrapped in his handkerchief.
Whatever it was, he threw it out of the cabin
port and breathed a sigh of relief when he had
done so. Two more trips were necessary before
the flooring was replaced, and each time Ned
threw something out.</p>

<p>Herc was about to ask his comrade what he
was doing, when the preliminary fumbling at
the bolts above warned him that they were about
to have a visitor.</p>

<p>Instantly both lads resumed the same positions
they had occupied when Herr Muller left the
cabin. They had just time to assume them when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the man himself opened the companionway doorway
and descended.</p>

<p>"Well, have you made up your minds?" he began,
without any preliminaries.</p>

<p>"We have," replied Ned. "I'll do as you wish
in regard to the plan of the battleship. But
you haven't mentioned anything about compensation
as yet."</p>

<p>"It will be large. You have my word for that.
Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>Ned, inwardly thinking that it certainly wasn't,
agreed that it was.</p>

<p>"I'll get you pencils and paper, and you can
set to work right away," said Herr Muller.</p>

<p>But just as he spoke there came a loud crash
on deck, and a series of alarmed shouts. Herr
Muller turned and sprang quickly back up the
stairway. The boys, feeling certain that some
calamity had occurred, followed him.</p>

<p>As they gained the deck they were astonished
to find that the sloop was out of sight of land. A
desolate expanse of gray, tumbling billows was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
stretched about her. But their glances only
dwelt on this for an instant. Their immediate
attention was caught by a group in the stern,
bending over a prostrate figure.</p>

<p>"It's Chance!" exclaimed Ned, hastening aft,
followed by Herc.</p>

<p>"A block tore loose from above and struck
him on the head," one of the followers of Herr
Muller was explaining as the boys came up.</p>

<p>The leader of the strange band bent over the
unconscious man and felt his head with a manner
that betokened some medical skill.</p>

<p>"It is only a flesh wound," he said, "but the
shock has made him unconscious. Carry him
below, some of you. He'll soon be all right
again."</p>

<p>Kennell was one of those who volunteered for
this service. Merritt was another. As they
passed the two boys, carrying their limp burden,
Kennell turned to Ned:</p>

<p>"Well, my young sneak, they've got you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
collared this time," he said with a leer, "you
walked into the trap like a baby taking candy."</p>

<p>Ned did not deign to reply to the fellow. Instead,
he listened to Herr Muller who was talking
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Of all unlucky things to happen at this time,"
he was saying. "We shall be within the wireless
zone of the fleet at any time now, and the only
man on board who understands wireless is incapacitated.
It is most unfortunate."</p>

<p>A sudden idea came to Ned. Possibly by volunteering
to act in Chance's place he might find
a way out of the maze that involved them.</p>

<p>Acting on his impulse he stepped up to Muller.</p>

<p>"I understand wireless," he said; "what messages
do you want taken?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," rejoined Herr Muller,
looking much relieved. Then suddenly his manner
changed.</p>

<p>"But you understand the naval code, too, don't
you?"</p>

<p>The manner in which the question was worded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
put Ned on his guard. He saw that it would be
better to reply in the negative.</p>

<p>"No," he said, shaking his head, "I haven't
had much to do with the signal part of man-o'-war
work; but, of course, I learned something of
wireless at the naval school."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Herr Muller; "come with
me."</p>

<p>He ushered the boys below&mdash;for Herc had
trailed along&mdash;and into the small wireless room
Ned had noticed.</p>

<p>"I am expecting a message at any time now,"
he said; "but it will come in cipher. Get it absolutely
accurate and you will not suffer by it."</p>

<p>Ned nodded.</p>

<p>"Better see about hoisting your aerials," he
said.</p>

<p>Herr Muller hurried off on this errand, while
Ned looked over the instruments surrounding
him. They glistened with brass and polished
steel in the smoky light of a bulkhead lamp. But
despite the evident haste with which they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
been installed, it was easy to see that the apparatus
was the finest obtainable.</p>

<p>"What on earth can be up now?" wondered
Herc, as Ned took up the metal headpiece and
adjusted it.</p>

<p>"Don't know yet," said Ned. "It's evident,
though, that Muller is in hopes of picking up
some information from the fleet by eavesdropping
on its wireless. I'm mighty glad now that
I didn't tell him I could read cipher."</p>

<p>Further conversation was interrupted by the
re-entrance of Herr Muller. He stepped
brusquely up to Ned.</p>

<p>"You had better be ready to catch anything
you can," he said; "everything is in readiness
above, and we should be picking up messages at
any moment now."</p>

<p>Ned nodded and sat down on the stool set over
against the table, on which the glittering array
of instruments were fastened.</p>

<p>For a long time&mdash;or so it seemed to him&mdash;he
sat thus. Suddenly, in his ears, there sounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the faintest of scratching sounds. It was as soft
as the footsteps of an invalid fly. But Ned knew
that somewhere out on the sea ship was speaking
to ship, and that what he heard was the echo of
their talk.</p>

<p>Suddenly he picked up a pencil and began to
write rapidly. Herr Muller bent over his shoulder.
He watched with keen absorption as Ned's
pencil flew over the paper.</p>

<p>"<i>Yes, she's all right; but she's not as pretty as
the blonde operator at Key West.</i>"</p>

<p>"Is that the message you were expecting?" inquired
Ned blandly, gazing up at Herr Muller.</p>

<p>"What nonsense is dot?" sputtered the other,
lapsing into his foreign accent.</p>

<p>"Well, since you ask me," rejoined Ned, "I
think it's the operator on one coasting steamer
talking to the wireless man on another vessel
about a blonde young lady at Key West."</p>

<p>Herr Muller exploded.</p>

<p>"Vot I care aboudt blonde young vimins?" he
demanded, pounding the table angrily. "Der<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
message I vant iss a navy message, you onderstond
dot?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it?" inquired Ned, assuming
great innocence. "I thought you wanted every
message that came through the air.&mdash;Hullo!&mdash;Hush!&mdash;Here
she comes now!"</p>

<p>Suddenly a new note had struck into the wireless
channels. The quick, imperious call of a battleship
summoning the wireless ears of another
sea-fighter.</p>

<p>"<i>M-n! M-n! M-n!</i>"</p>

<p>"It's the <i>Manhattan</i> being called by the flagship,"
muttered Ned. "Hullo! now they're answering."</p>

<p>"<i>Squadron will rendezvous at Blackhaven Bay.</i>
Will await further instructions there," he translated
rapidly. But his translation was mental
only. To Herr Muller he handed only a string
of figures, the cipher the two vessels had been
using. Muller hastened off with it to Chance's
cabin. The man had now recovered from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
swoon and might be able to translate the message.</p>

<p>Ned took instant advantage of the situation.</p>

<p>With quick, nervous fingers he began pounding
the sending key. The lithe, white spark
crackled and flashed across the terminals. It
crackled like a bunch of firecrackers.</p>

<p>"<i>M-n! M-n! M-n!</i>" was what the boy kept
pounding out.</p>

<p>Would the <i>Manhattan</i> never answer?</p>

<p>The spark crackled on, but no answering flash
came through the air.</p>

<p>"The apparatus is too weak," groaned Ned,
despairing at the long silence. But at the same
instant his heart gave a great pound. His pulses
began to leap. Through space had come an answering
message.</p>

<p>Ned lost no time. His fingers began to pound
the sending key once more.</p>

<p>"<i>Danger. At Blackhaven</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>The interruption was sharp and startling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Splinters flew from under Ned's fingers as the
bullet smashed the sending key to smithereens.
He turned swiftly. In the doorway stood Merritt,
revolver in hand. It was the recreant seaman
who had fired the shot and interrupted Ned's
warning message.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i5large.jpg"><img src="images/i5.jpg" width="400" height="614" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p>In the doorway stood Merritt, revolver in hand.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"So you thought you'd tip us off to the <i>Manhattan</i>,
eh?" he snarled. "Well, you never made
a bigger mistake in your life. I know something
of wireless telegraphy myself."</p>

<p>Ned was conscious of nothing but a hot flame
of anger that seemed to bathe him from head to
foot in its fury. He flung the helmet from his
head and sprang at Merritt like a tiger. Taken
utterly by surprise, the fellow was carried clean
off his feet by the assault. He crashed backward
with Ned on top of him just as Herr Muller
rushed out of Chance's cabin, waving the cipher
message delightedly.</p>

<p>"The fleet is going to rendezvous at Blackhaven!"
he was shouting. "I was right, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped short as he almost stumbled over
the struggling forms of Ned and Merritt. In
the semi-darkness of the cabin and his excitement
he had not noticed them before.</p>

<p>"Donnervetter, vos is diss?" he cried as he
took in the situation and speedily sensed the fact
that Merritt was getting the worst of the
struggle.</p>

<p>He picked up a heavy chair that stood close
to his hand. He was swinging it and was about
to bring it crashing down on Ned's head when
something collided with his chin.</p>

<p>As Herr Muller, seeing a whole constellation
of stars, reeled backward, dropping the chair
with a bang, he dimly realized that that "something"
had been the brawny and freckled fist of
one Herc Taylor.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">NED, CAST AWAY.</p>


<p>But as Herc and Herr Muller crashed floorward
together a rush of footsteps came down
the companionway stairs. The shot that had destroyed
the sending key of the sloop's wireless
had been heard on deck. Rescue was at hand for
the two scoundrels who had been overborne by
the Dreadnought Boys.</p>

<p>Before hands could be laid on Herc, however,
the freckle-faced youth had banged his fists twice
into Herr Muller's face. He raised his hand for
a third blow when a sharp pain shot through him,
and he sank back with a groan of helpless pain.
Something had flashed in the anarchist's hand
for an instant and had buried itself in Herc's
side.</p>

<p>"Ned! Ned!" cried the lad in accents of shrill
alarm, "the fellow's stabbed me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>With a superhuman effort, Ned flung Merritt's
arms from him and dashed across the cabin.
Herr Muller had struggled to his feet. He rose
just in time to be spun clear across the cabin by
the infuriated Dreadnought Boy. Such was the
force in Ned's righteously indignant blow, that
before the anarchist leader ceased spinning, he
crashed clear through a wooden panel.</p>

<p>"Herc, old fellow!" cried Ned, sinking to his
knees beside his comrade, "are you badly hurt?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm all right, old chap. Save the
ships!" mumbled Herc and his eyes closed. The
freckled face grew fearfully white.</p>

<p>Before any of the excited crew could lay a
hand on him Ned picked up Herc as if he had
been a child, and began backing toward one of
the cabin doors with him.</p>

<p>"You scoundrels will pay dear for this!" he
shouted angrily as he went out.</p>

<p>Paralyzed for the time being by the lightning-like
rapidity of events, not one of the men made
a move just then. Ned bore Herc into the cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
unmolested. Chance, leaning on one elbow, was
lying in the lower bunk. His head was bandaged,
but Ned tumbled him out by the scruff
of his neck.</p>

<p>"Out of that, you traitor!" he shouted, "and
make room for a real man-o'-war's-man."</p>

<p>While Chance, still weak from the effects of his
blow, tottered about the cabin, Ned laid Herc on
the bunk as gently as a woman might have done
with an infant. Herc opened his eyes and smiled
up at his shipmate.</p>

<p>"Thanks, old fellow," he breathed, "I&mdash;I'm all
right. You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lapsed into unconsciousness once more.</p>

<p>Ned ripped his shirt open with a quick movement.
With another he tore it into sheds and
bandaged the wound in the lad's side. Luckily,
in the struggle, Herr Muller's aim had not been
good, and the knife thrust was little more than
a flesh wound, extending up under Herc's armpit.
But the pain was considerable.</p>

<p>Ned had hardly finished his work before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
men outside came out of their half-stunned
period of inaction. Headed by Merritt, they
charged at the cabin. Ned sprang for the door
to close and lock it against them, but Chance
was too quick for him. The fellow had been leaning
back against the bulkhead. As Ned swept
forward he extended his foot, and the Dreadnought
Boy came to the floor in a heap. In another
instant they were all piled on him. Ned
struck out furiously.</p>

<p>His blows were driven by steel-plated muscles,
but they had little effect on the sprawling mass
of humanity piled above him. Before many minutes
had passed Ned was a prisoner, tied and
bound as securely as Herc had been when he
was carried on board.</p>

<p>To his surprise, no violence was attempted by
his captors. They worked in grim silence. Ned
wondered vaguely what was going to happen to
him. In his dazed state he didn't much care.
Under Herr Muller's orders the lad was roughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
thrust into the wireless room and the door locked
upon him.</p>

<p>While this was being done he noted with satisfaction
that upon the faces of both Herr Muller
and Merritt sundry large, angry-looking
swellings were beginning to obtrude themselves
like purple plums.</p>

<p>"At any rate, I've spoiled Merritt's beauty for
him," thought Ned with a grim satisfaction.</p>

<p>He was left unmolested in his prison place for
what seemed hours. Finally, after an interminable
period, he began to notice that the rough
rolling motion of the sloop had ceased. Had the
sea gone down, or were they at anchor in some
sheltered haven, he wondered. He was not to
be long in doubt.</p>

<p>The door was flung open. Merritt, Kennell
and Muller entered. At a word from Muller
the powerless Ned was shoved and half carried
through the portal. Then he was propelled up
the companionway stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are they going to chuck me overboard?" he
found himself wondering.</p>

<p>A swift glance showed him that the sloop was
anchored in a small bay. The sky was clear and
a bright moon showed the surroundings to be
sand dunes and desolate barrens.</p>

<p>"Is the boat ready?" he heard Muller ask.</p>

<p>From over side, where the sloop's dinghy was
floating, came a response in the affirmative. The
next instant Ned found himself tumbled from
the sloop's low side into the small craft. The
fall bruised him considerably, but if his captors
had expected him to make any outcry they were
deceived. He uttered no word of complaint, although,
what with the tightness of his bonds and
the jouncing his fall had given him, he was in
considerable pain.</p>

<p>Herr Muller, Chance, Merritt and Kennell
dropped into the boat after him, taking the places
of the two men who had unlimbered it from the
stern davits.</p>

<p>Evidently their plans had been prearranged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
for Chance and Merritt fell to the oars without
uttering a word. Muller and Kennell, grim and
silent, sat in the stern.</p>

<p>It was a short row to the shore, and presently
the bow of the boat grated on a sandy beach.</p>

<p>"Chuck him out!" growled Herr Muller.</p>

<p>Ned was tumbled unceremoniously out on the
sands. In the moonlight he could see that the
men in the boat were keeping him covered with
pistols. Muller leaped out by his side.</p>

<p>"Keep him covered while I cut him loose,"
Ned heard Muller grate out.</p>

<p>The anarchist bent over him and severed his
bonds.</p>

<p>"What on earth is he doing that for?" wondered
Ned. But he was duly grateful as he felt
his limbs free once more.</p>

<p>The task of cutting the ropes completed, Herr
Muller lost no time in jumping back into the boat.
But he need not have feared Ned, the lad was too
stiff and sore to do more than feebly stretch his
limbs. As soon as Muller was on board, Chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and Merritt laid hold of the bow of the boat and
shoved off. They leaped nimbly on board as the
little craft floated.</p>

<p>As they fell to their oars Muller stood up in
the stern and shouted something back at Ned.
The boy could not catch all of it, but he was to
realize its import before long. All his ears could
get of the message was something about "Island&mdash;rot
there!"</p>

<p>Then came the rhythmic splash of oars as the
boat was pulled swiftly back to the sloop. After
a while Ned, although the effort made his
cramped limbs wince, managed to get to his feet.
He was just in time to see the sails of the sloop
being hoisted and the little vessel, as they filled,
stagger and move out toward the open sea once
more.</p>

<p>"And poor Herc, wounded and alone, is on
board her," was Ned's bitter thought; "but,
thank goodness," he murmured the next instant,
"I'm on land and free, and it won't be long before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
I find some means of running down that
sloop."</p>

<p>He sat down and chafed his ankles and wrists,
and after a while was able to move about freely.
As soon as he did so he struck off across the
sandy dunes on which he had been set ashore.
A few minutes of walking brought him to a
broad arm of water. It flowed swiftly under the
moonlight.</p>

<p>A sudden flash of fear shot through Ned. He
gave a slight shiver as an alarming idea shot
through his mind. But he shook off his presentiment
and struck out once more. It was not till
he had made the third circuit of the shifting,
grass-grown dunes that he realized, with a flash
of horror, the bitter truth of his situation.</p>

<p>The inexplicable fact of his freedom and of his
bonds being cast off was fully explained now.</p>

<p>Herr Muller had marooned the lad on a desolate
island. It was cut off from the shore by a
swift flowing arm of water, its current so broad
and so rapid that even such a strong swimmer as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Ned did not dare trust himself to try to cross it.</p>

<p>By a stern effort of will Ned repressed a desire
to cry aloud. Was this to be his destiny?
To perish on a sandy islet off the Atlantic Coast,
while the sloop forged ahead on her errand of
destruction?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A STRIKE FOR UNCLE SAM.</p>


<p>How long it was that Ned sat reviewing the
situation in all its bearings he never knew. But
it must have been a considerable period, for,
when he began to take notice of his surroundings
once more, the first flush of an early summer's
dawn was visible behind him as he faced what
he judged to be the mainland.</p>

<p>The light showed the character of the country
across the broad channel which separated him
from it to be much the same as that of the island
on which he had been marooned by the anarchists.
It was criss-crossed with sand dunes till it
resembled a crumpled bit of yellow parchment.
Scanty, spear-like grass grew in hummocks on
the undulations. As the light became stronger
sea birds began to whirl about him, screaming
weirdly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned gazed seaward. Far out on the horizon
was a smudge of black smoke. It was too great
in volume for one vessel to have made. The
cloud reached as far as the eye could see; as if a
gigantic and dirty thumb had been swept across
the sky line. To Ned it meant one thing.</p>

<p>"The fleet has passed down the coast on its
way to Blackhaven," he mused. "Oh! for a
chance to get to the mainland."</p>

<p>For a time he was in hopes that some fishing
craft, or small boat, might pass within hail. But
nothing of the kind occurred.</p>

<p>"I've got to get something to eat pretty soon,"
thought Ned, who was beginning to feel faint,
"or&mdash;hullo! where have I seen that log before?"</p>

<p>His gaze was riveted on a big spar that was
drifting idly through the arm of sea that swept
between him and the land.</p>

<p>"I saw that fellow go through here last night;
the tide must have turned and it's drifting back.
Well, that settles it. There's almost as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
water and current in there at low water as at
high."</p>

<p>He fell to pacing the beach moodily. Once
in desperation he waded into the turbid water
and essayed to swim. But he was instantly swept
from his feet, and a strong undertow seized on
his legs and drew them down. When, panting
and trembling, he stood once more on shore, he
resolved not to risk his life in that manner again.</p>

<p>"An elephant couldn't swim that," he said to
himself sadly.</p>

<p>All at once he looked up, from one of his despairing
moods, to see something that caused him
to choke and gasp with hope. Bobbing about on
the water, not a hundred yards from the shore,
was&mdash;of all things&mdash;a small boat!</p>

<p>Ned watched it fascinated.</p>

<p>Would the current drift it within his reach,
or would it be carried tantalizingly past him?
At the moment he gave little thought as to how
it came to be there. It was enough for him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
it was a boat, and offered&mdash;providing he could
reach it&mdash;a means of getting to the mainland.</p>

<p>In an agony of apprehension he watched the
little craft as it came on, dancing merrily on the
choppy ripples of the inlet. Now it shot in toward
the shore, as if it meant to drive bow-on
upon the beach, and then, as Ned sprang forth
to grasp it, the current would sweep it out of his
reach. At last it was abreast of him, and in the
next second it had passed beyond. Ned grew
desperate.</p>

<p>"Better die in the effort to get to land than
perish here of starvation and thirst," he thought.</p>

<p>Without bothering to kick his shoes off he
sprang into the water, which was deep right up
to the margin of the shore, and swam out after
the boat.</p>

<p>In a flash he felt the undertow grip him. He
struck out with every ounce of reserve strength
that he possessed, but the current proved the
stronger of the two. Ned, weakened by his long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
fast and rough experiences, found himself being
rapidly drawn under.</p>

<p>Fighting every inch of the way he was gradually
submerged. With a last effort he struck
out again, but the final struggle proved too much
for his already depleted muscles.</p>

<p>The boy was sucked under like a straw.</p>

<p>Where his head had appeared a second before,
there was now nothing but the whirl of the
waters.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just as it felt as if his lungs must
burst, Ned was shot up to the surface once more.
Too weak to strike out he flung out his hands in
a desperate effort to clutch at anything to sustain
his weight.</p>

<p>His hands closed on something solid that
buoyed him up refreshingly. It was the gunwale
of the boat!</p>

<p>Ned hung limply to her side, getting back his
strength as she glided along. After several minutes
he felt equal to the effort of trying to board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
her. He kicked his way round to the stern and
clambered over the transom.</p>

<p>Once on board he lay languidly on the thwarts
for some time, too much exhausted even to move.
But by-and-bye, his strength began to trickle
back. He raised himself and looked around him.
About the first object his eyes lighted on was a
bit of crumpled paper in the bottom of the craft.</p>

<p>"Maybe this is some sort of a clew as to how
the boat happened along so providentially,"
thought Ned.</p>

<p>He opened the paper, scanned the few words it
contained, and then his jaw dropped in sheer
amazement. The words of the note were in
Herc's big, scrawly handwriting.</p>

<p>"<i>Ned, Hope you find the boat. I heard them
say they had marooned you on an island, so I cut
the rope. Herc.</i>"</p>

<p>Ned saw at once what had happened, even if
a glance at the cut end of rope in the bow had
not told him. Herc had managed to reach out
of the cabin port and slash the rope by which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
dinghy had been attached to the sloop's stern.
It had been a long chance, but it had won out.</p>

<p>"I don't believe there's another chap in the
world like good old Herc," thought Ned tenderly,
with a suspicious mist in his eyes as he thought
of his absent comrade; then he took up the oars.</p>

<p>"Now where shall I row to?" he asked himself,
as he pulled the boat along.</p>

<p>He scanned the barren-looking coast, with its
inhospitable sand dunes and melancholy-colored
grass, with the sea birds wheeling and screaming
above.</p>

<p>"Humph! Not much choice, apparently. I
guess I'll pull just inside of that little point yonder,
and then strike out across the country. I'll
have to trust to luck to find somebody who'll
give me a hand."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Ned pulled the small boat
ashore and abandoned it.</p>

<p>When he landed he had cherished some hopes
of finding a fisherman's hut, or "beachcomber's"
dwelling behind the rampart of sand dunes. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
no trace of even such primitive habitations met
his eye. Salt meadows, threaded by muddy, sluggish
creeks, lay inland, and beyond was rising
ground dotted with clumps of woodland.</p>

<p>This looked hopeful. Determined to keep pegging
along to the uttermost that was in him, Ned
struck out across the salt meadows.</p>

<p>It was harder work than he had thought. Under
the hot sun the miasmic salt land steamed and
perspired. Rank odors arose, and the muddy
creeks steamed. Once or twice he had to wade
through the foul water courses, and, at such
times myriads of bloated-looking crabs, that had
been sunning themselves, scuttled, with splashes,
into the water.</p>

<p>To add to his discomfort, as the sun grew
higher, millions of black flies and stinging midges
arose to plague him. They settled on him in
swarms. Every time Ned wiped out a legion of
the tormentors that had settled on his face, his
countenance bore a red smudge. By the time he
had&mdash;he hardly knew how&mdash;traversed this bad bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
of country and found himself on a dusty white
highroad, Ned was scarcely a presentable-looking
object. Mud, from the creeks he had waded,
caked his legs; his face was red and bloody from
the onslaughts of the insects. His clothes were
tattered from his fight on the sloop, and, altogether,
he was not an object to inspire confidence.</p>

<p>To add to his misfortunes, he had no money,
and Ned knew enough of the world to know that
a lad in his condition, tattered and penniless, does
not, as a rule, excite any feeling but suspicion.
However, when about half a mile further on he
came to a small house nestling among rose vines
and creepers, he walked bravely up to the door
and knocked.</p>

<p>A prim-looking old maid, in a checked apron,
opened the door. As soon as her eyes fell on
Ned she uttered a shrill scream and slammed the
door with an exclamation of alarm and indignation.</p>

<p>"Get along with you, you tramp!" she cried.</p>

<p>Ned turned and trudged down the footpath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
But, as he reached the gate, he heard a commotion
behind him. He turned just in time to face
a big, savage-looking bulldog that was about to
fly at his leg. Ned raised his foot and planted it
fair and square on the snarling animal's mouth.</p>

<p>The dog fled with a yelp of pain. Ned followed
it with his eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll bet that cur has fared better than I have
for the last twenty-four hours," he muttered as
he once more began his weary trudging along the
dusty highroad.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SOME ADVENTURES BY THE WAY.</p>


<p>By noon his hunger was positively ravenous.
Yet he did not like to risk another rebuff by asking
for something to eat at any of the thrifty-looking
farmhouses he passed.</p>

<p>Of course, Ned could have represented himself
as one of Uncle Sam's sailors, but it was,
somehow, repugnant to him&mdash;the idea of asking
for food and urging, as an excuse for the petition,
the uniform he was entitled to wear and the
flag he served under.</p>

<p>All at once as he rounded a turn in the road he
came upon a scene that quickened his hunger tenfold.
A group of men, women and children were
bivouacked under a tree enjoying the shade, and
were evidently about to enjoy a picnic lunch.
Two or three buggies, and an aged carry-all stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
near at hand. Ned, with averted gaze, was hurrying
by, when a voice hailed him.</p>

<p>"Hullo, there, shipmate!"</p>

<p>Ned turned quickly. It was a middle-aged
man, with a sunburned face, dressed in a prosperous
farmer's best, who had hailed him.</p>

<p>"Sam Topping!" exclaimed Ned, genuinely
pleased, "what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Why, picnicking, as you see. But what on
earth does all this mean?" his eyes roamed over
Ned's disreputable figure. "What has happened?
What are you tramping about in that rig for?"</p>

<p>Sam Topping had served on the <i>Manhattan</i>
during Ned's days as a raw apprentice. He had
retired, a short time before, on a well-earned
pension, and his savings had served to buy him
a farm. Ned recalled now having heard that
Sam had settled down in that part of the country.</p>

<p>The lad colored as Sam put his question. He
could feel the women and children of the group
looking curiously at him, while the men regarded
him with more frank curiosity. It was plain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
they looked upon him as a tramp or something of
the kind. A traveling peddler, possibly.</p>

<p>As Sam seemed to be waiting for an answer to
his question, Ned drew him aside. He told
him as much of his story as he thought advisable.
Sam was sympathetic. He invited Ned to lunch
with them, and after the lad had washed and
made himself more presentable at a small stream,
he joined the party. They made him welcome,
and no embarrassing questions were asked. Sam
had concocted a story to fit the case while Ned
was at his wayside ablutions. How good that
food tasted to the half-famished boy! He could
not help thinking, in the midst of his enjoyment,
of poor Herc. He wondered sadly how his shipmate
was faring.</p>

<p>With this came another thought. The safety
of the fleet was imperilled. Its salvation lay in
his hands. He alone could give warning of the
danger that threatened from the anarchists.
When he got an opportunity, he questioned the
friendly Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"How far is it to Blackhaven?"</p>

<p>"Well, let's see," rejoined Sam thoughtfully,
"it's about one hundred miles to the closest point.
But Blackhaven Bay, where the warships go, is
twenty miles from a railroad, and only a few
fishing villages are on its shores. It's a wild and
desolate spot."</p>

<p>"I've got to get there," said Ned.</p>

<p>Sam looked at him as if doubtful that he was
in his right mind.</p>

<p>"Get to Blackhaven!" he exclaimed. "What
for?"</p>

<p>"To join my ship," explained Ned, not wishing
to go into details concerning the anarchists. Sam
was a talkative person, and if all he knew was
noised abroad it might defeat the justice Ned
was grimly determined to visit on them.</p>

<p>Sam had already explained the occasion of the
roadside picnic. The party was composed of himself
and several of his neighbors on their way into
Dundertown, about five miles off, to witness a
performance of the circus. Ned had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
noted upon barns and outhouses as he came along
the gaudy colored posters announcing its arrival.
They had interested him particularly, as one flaming
bill had set forth the wonderful aerial feats
of one Professor Luminetti, who was modestly
billed as "The King of the Air." The professor,
it appeared, performed his feats in an aeroplane
of similar construction to the one which Ned had
been using.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see that chap," Ned had thought, as
he regarded the pictures.</p>

<p>"Tell you what you do, Ned, old shipmate,"
quoth Sam suddenly. "You come into town with
us and see the circus. There's a recruiting office
in Dundertown. You can go there afterward
and tell them your story. They'll probably advance
you the money to get back to your ship."</p>

<p>Ned agreed that this would be a good idea.
But he declined the circus invitation. He was too
anxious, for reasons of which we know, to rejoin
the fleet. The gravest danger threatened the
flower of the American navy, and, for all Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
knew, its fate depended on the speed with which
he could reach Blackhaven.</p>

<p>Soon afterward the farmers and their wives
clambered into their rigs and started driving toward
town. Sam, who was unmarried, drove
alone, and Ned shared a seat in his buggy. It
seemed to his tired frame and blistered, worn feet,
the most luxurious conveyance he had ever
known. Sam drove straight on to the circus lot.
It presented a lively scene of shifting color and
action.</p>

<p>Bright flags, huge erections of lumping canvas,
blaring brass bands were everywhere. In front
of the main tent a big crowd had gathered. Sam
and Ned were caught in a swirl of humanity and
rushed toward it. By a shifting of the crowd
they soon found themselves in its midst. The
throng was grouped about an aeroplane, the
motor of which was already whirring and buzzing.
By it stood a man in red tights, bright with
spangles. He was lecturing on the points of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
machine, which formed a "free attraction" to
draw the crowds.</p>

<p>Ned smiled as he listened. The fellow evidently
didn't know much about his subject. But even at
that, he knew more than his listeners, who gazed
on him, gaping and awestruck. It was the first
time that most of them had seen an aeroplane at
close range. The sight seemed to fascinate them.</p>

<p>"I will now make a short flight," announced the
man as he finished, and as he clambered into the
seat, a regular "barker" began shouting at the
top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Lum-in-e-t-t-i! The King of the Ae-ar! See
him in his unprecedented frantic, furious, thrilling
flight into space! Watch him soar toward
the haunt of the eagle bird and cloud-land! The
sight of a century! The wonder of the nations!
Lumin-e-t-t-i! Luminett-i-i-i-i-i! The Ke-eng of
the Ae-ar!"</p>

<p>The crowd came running from all directions at
the cry. It was soon packed so densely about
"The King of the Air" that Ned and Sam found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
themselves almost within touching distance of the
wing tips. All at once Ned's trained eye noted
something. A link in one of the drive chains of
the propellers was badly twisted.</p>

<p>Under a sudden strain it would be likely
to snap.</p>

<p>He stepped forward and touched "The King of
the Air" on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well," growled the King gruffly, "what's up?"</p>

<p>His gruffness was not unnatural. He saw in
Ned only a rather tattered-looking member of the
crowd, and <i>not</i> one of the most competent airmen
of the United States Navy.</p>

<p>"One of the links on your drive chain is
twisted," said Ned; "I thought I'd tell you."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is, is it?" brusquely rejoined the other;
"since when have you qualified as an expert?"</p>

<p>"It's dangerous," Ned warned him again in an
earnest voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, mind your own business," was the impatient
reply; "it's all right, I guess. Anyhow, I'm
not taking lessons from a Rube."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>The crowd began to laugh and jeer. A big man
in a loud check suit, and with an aggressive black
moustache, came bustling up.</p>

<p>"Now, then! Now, then!" he exclaimed truculently.
"What's up here? What do you want,
young man?"</p>

<p>"This man's machine is not in a condition for
a flight," exclaimed Ned hotly.</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't, eh?" he said sarcastically. "Well,
I tell you what, young man, you be off, or you'll
be in no condition for a flight, either, 'cause I'll
have you locked up!"</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! ho!" roared the crowd.</p>

<p>"All right. If he's injured, it will be his own
and your fault," said Ned sharply.</p>

<p>Burning with mortification, he elbowed his way
through the crowd to its outskirts. As he reached
them he heard a deep-throated murmur.</p>

<p>"He's off!"</p>

<p>"Hooray!" shouted the crowd, but in a jiffy
their cheering changed to a groan of dismay.
There was a sharp crack like a pistol shot. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
twisted link had parted under the strain of the
engine, as Ned knew it would.</p>

<p>Luckily, the accident had happened just as the
aeroplane began to move, and no damage was
done to machine or aviator. Waiting only to
ascertain this, Ned took his leave of Sam, and
set out for the recruiting office to tell his story.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"YOU ARE A PRISONER OF THE GOVERNMENT!"</p>


<p>He found it without much difficulty. It was
located in a building in the centre of the town.
The Stars and Stripes hung from the doorway.
Ned saluted the flag as he passed under it. His
heart beat more hopefully, and his step lightened
and quickened. Already he felt as if his troubles
were over.</p>

<p>A rather gruff-looking, red-faced quartermaster
was in charge. He looked up sharply from
a paper-littered desk as Ned entered.</p>

<p>"Well," he said quickly, "what can I do for
you?"</p>

<p>"A good deal," rejoined Ned, and launched
into his story forthwith.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the man, when he concluded,
"and so you want money to rejoin the fleet at
Blackhaven?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Ned. "I have, as I hinted, a good
reason for my request. If I had had the money,
I should have lost no time in communicating with
Lieutenant De Frees."</p>

<p>"Humph! By the way, just tell me your name,
young man."</p>

<p>"Strong&mdash;Ned Strong," rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>The red-faced man grew redder than ever, and
burrowed among his papers like an industrious
rabbit. At last he unearthed what he wanted and
scanned it closely. He kept glancing from the
paper to Ned, and from Ned to the paper, till the
lad felt quite embarrassed. At last he finished.</p>

<p>"Humph!" he said, with his usual preparatory
clearing of the throat, "so you are Ned Strong.
It's a lucky thing you came in here, Strong."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Ned, with a smile. "Of
course, I hope it's lucky for me," he added
quickly.</p>

<p>"Humph! No, it's lucky for me," insisted the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that so?" asked Ned, not knowing just what
else to say.</p>

<p>The red-faced man rose to his feet, and, without
another word, went into an adjoining room.
Ned could hear him telephoning, but could not
catch the words. He came back presently and
sat down at his table once more.</p>

<p>"Can you advance me the money?" demanded
Ned. "It's very important, you know, that I
should start as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; humph! by all means; humph! the
money is on its way from the bank now."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Ned simply.</p>

<p>"It must be a large sum," he thought to himself.</p>

<p>He picked up a paper that lay near at hand.
Idly, to pass the time, he scanned it. Sandwiched
in amidst the sensational news&mdash;for which Ned's
wholesome mind did not care&mdash;was a headline
that caught his eye:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Fleet Sails for Blackhaven.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned's heart pounded violently. The recollection
of that fluttering wireless message he had
caught came back to him. With it, also, came a
vivid remembrance of the torpedoes under the
floor of the anarchists' craft.</p>

<p>Suddenly another item caught his eye:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mysterious Happening at Naval Aero Station&mdash;Two
Navy Aviators Missing
With Sum of Money.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>All at once Ned caught his own name and then
Herc's. The type swam before him for an instant,
but he steadied his vision and read on. The
paper gave a sensational account of their mysterious
disappearance from the hotel in Bartonville.
It also stated that Herc had drawn some
of the money intrusted to their care just before
he left.</p>

<p>"The men are being sought for by the department,"
the despatch added, "and when arrested
will be summarily dealt with. Every recruiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
office and naval station in the country, as well as
the police, have been notified."</p>

<p>Ned looked up from his paper with startled
eyes. He caught the gaze of the red-faced quartermaster
fixed accusingly on him.</p>

<p>"So you've read it?" said that dignitary.</p>

<p>"I've read a lot of sensational rubbish," was
the hot reply.</p>

<p>"Not half so sensational or rubbishy as what
you've told me," sniffed the quartermaster.</p>

<p>"That being the case," said Ned hotly, "I shall
not bother you further. Good afternoon."</p>

<p>"Hold on there! Humph! humph! Not so
fast!" exclaimed the other, rising and stepping
swiftly between Ned and the door, "you've to
wait here a while."</p>

<p>"Wait!" echoed Ned. "I can't wait. Why,
man alive, the safety of the fleet depends on my
reaching there."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! You don't mean to say you've
brooded over that story so much you believe it
yourself?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned was first thunderstruck and then horrified.
In living through the extraordinary events of
the recent past, it had never struck him how fantastic
and impossible they would seem to the average
man.</p>

<p>"But it's true, I tell you! I can prove it, every
word!" he burst out.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Why, by my shipmate, Hercules Taylor."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"A prisoner on that sloop."</p>

<p>"Come, come, young man. You've been reading
too many dime novels. Why, there isn't a
court martial in the land that would believe
such a cock-and-bull story. I'll wager that your
chum Taylor is hiding some place around town
while you came up here to try and raise some
more money. I must say it was a nervy thing
to do."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" cried Ned. "Do you mean to
say that you don't credit a word of my story?"</p>

<p>"Nary a word. A wilder yarn I never listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
to, and I've served on all kinds of craft, man and
boy, for a good many years. Now, let me give
you a bit of advice, young fellow. When you are
on trial, don't spring any such gammoning as
you've told me. Just stick to the plain truth and
you may get off lighter than you otherwise
would."</p>

<p>Ned gasped. For an instant he almost lost control
of himself. But he realized that, if he was
to be of service to the fleet, he must keep his self-possession.</p>

<p>"When I rejoin the fleet," he said, "it won't
be as a prisoner."</p>

<p>"Won't, eh? Don't be too sure of that," was
the response.</p>

<p>A sudden heavy tramping was heard on the
stairs.</p>

<p>The quartermaster flung open the door.</p>

<p>"Here he is now," he called out, "the fellow
Strong. Take him into custody and lock him up
till I arrange with the naval authorities to have
him sent back to his ship."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke, several heavy-footed men filed
into the room. They all bore the unmistakable
stamp of the country constable.</p>

<p>Ned's tongue almost stuck to the roof of his
mouth, it grew so dry. Every nerve in his body
quivered. Was it possible that all this was real?
It seemed more like an ugly nightmare.</p>

<p>"Look here," he exclaimed, in a voice he tried
to render calm and collected, "this has gone far
enough. Everything can be explained. But you
mustn't lock me up now. Let me go back to the
fleet. There is a conspiracy on foot to destroy
some of the ships. I must warn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A rough laugh interrupted him.</p>

<p>"What kind er moonshine be that, young
chap?" grinned the constable. "Yer don't go ter
thinkin' we puts any stock in such talk as thet,
do yer? If yer do, yer mus' think we're 'dunderheads'
jes 'cos this is Dundertown. Na-ow, come
on! Air you comin' quiet, or air yer comin'
rough?"</p>

<p>Ned turned to the quartermaster, who stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
pompously puffed up, surveying the civil authorities
with a patronizing air.</p>

<p>"Remember, officer," he said, "humph! the prisoner
is not a civil prisoner. He is only placed
in your temporary care by me as a representative
of the United States government."</p>

<p>"Ve-ree well," rejoined the constable; "we'll
take care of him, by heck! Jes' bin pinin' ter put
some 'un in ther new jail. Thet reminds me,
we've got another prisoner ter pick up daown ter
ther circus grounds."</p>

<p>"His name isn't Taylor, this chap's companion,
humph?" demanded the quartermaster.</p>

<p>"No. It's jes' a pickpocket. We'll go by the
circus on our way to ther lock-up. It's only a
step out'n our way. Come on, young feller."</p>

<p>He extended a pair of handcuffs. Ned burned
with shame and mortification. Suddenly he bethought
himself of Sam and all the picnic party
at the circus. What if they should see him with
handcuffs on? What would they think?</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake," he begged, "don't put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
those things on me. I'll give you my word of
honor not to try to escape if you don't."</p>

<p>"Wa-al, I dunno," said the constable doubtfully,
"handcuffs is reg-lar, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Put them on him&mdash;humph!" shrilled the quartermaster.</p>

<p>Luckily, this ill-natured interruption turned the
tide in Ned's favor.</p>

<p>"Say, quartermaster," snapped the constable,
"this man is er civil prisoner, fer the time being,
an' what I say goes. Don't you go ter buttin' in."</p>

<p>"Ain't you going to put handcuffs on him?"
exclaimed the naval officer.</p>

<p>"No, I bean't."</p>

<p>"I order you to."</p>

<p>"Keep yer orders fer ther navy. I'm constable
uv this taown, an' I say this prisoner don't wear
'em."</p>

<p>"I'll report you to&mdash;to the president," was the
tremendous threat of the pompous quartermaster,
who had turned as red as an angry turkey cock.</p>

<p>"Even ther president of this United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
ain't a-goin' ter say ha-ow things is to be run in
Dundertown," snapped the constable. He laid a
hand on Ned's elbow.</p>

<p>"Come on, young man," he said, "you promised
to come quietly, remember."</p>

<p>Ned turned imploringly to the quartermaster.</p>

<p>"You have taken the oath of allegiance to the
navy," he said passionately. "Now act up to it.
Find some means to warn the fleet at Blackhaven
that anarchists are going to try to torpedo some
of the ships. Warn them against a black sloop
with a red line round her bulwarks."</p>

<p>"Warn them against a fiddlestick!" sniffed the
quartermaster. "Who ever heard such nonsense?
Humph!"</p>

<p>Ned almost groaned aloud as he was ushered
out, with a deputy on either side of him. But he
managed to control himself. The lad had been
in many tight places in foreign lands, and in active
service. But not one of them had been more
trying to bear up under than this disaster that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
had befallen him in a peaceful country town in his
native land.</p>

<p>"When will my case be heard?" Ned asked, as
they reached the street. He was in hopes that
if it was to come up immediately he could convince
the magistrate, or whatever dignitary he was
tried by, that his arrest was absolutely unjustified.</p>

<p>"Wa-al, squire won't be back to ta-own till day
arter ter-morrer," was the reply that dashed his
hopes. "Anyhow, he couldn't do nuthin' fer yer.
We're only holding yer here. You're a prisoner
of the United States government."</p>

<p>Those were the bitterest words that Ned had
ever heard. They seemed to sear his very being.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DASH FOR FREEDOM.</p>


<p>To Ned's intense relief, the little cortege did
not attract much attention as it passed down
the street. Most of the town was at the circus,
attracted, doubtless, by the prospect of a big, free
aeroplane flight.</p>

<p>At last they reached the circus grounds. The
performance had commenced, and the spaces outside
the tents in which it was going on were
almost deserted. Only a few canvasmen and
hangers-on lounged about. From time to time a
loud blare of music or a shout of applause came
from the tent. Over by the main entrance Ned
saw Professor Luminetti, still tinkering with his
aeroplane. Some men were helping him. Among
them was the man with the big moustache, who
had addressed Ned so roughly when he pointed
out the defective link.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, professor," he was exclaiming, as the
constable came up, "that's done. I guess everything
is all right now for the night performance."</p>

<p>"It all came from not paying attention to what
that young chap said," put in one of them.</p>

<p>"Yes, the professor thought he knew it all,"
put in another.</p>

<p>"Hullo! There's the young chap now," said
the black-moustached man, who was the manager
of the show. "Say, young feller, you're all right.
Any time you want a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was about to shake Ned by the hand, when
the constable interposed.</p>

<p>"You the manager of this sheebang?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What of it?"</p>

<p>"Wa-al, I'm ther constable. Whar's that pickpocket
yer telephoned about?"</p>

<p>"Right inside the sideshow tent. We put him
in there under the guard of two canvasmen."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll come and git him. Two uv
you boys guard the prisoner here while I'm gone."</p>

<p>He hastened off. Ned felt his face burn as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
some of the men who had been clustered about
Professor Luminetti gazed curiously at him. The
word "prisoner" had attracted their attention.</p>

<p>The professor was too busy with his machine
to pay any attention. He was starting up the engine
to test it. The motor burred wildly and emitted
flashes of flame and blue smoke. Suddenly
he looked around.</p>

<p>"Say, young feller," he said to Ned, "if you
know so much about aeroplanes, just tell me what
ails this motor?"</p>

<p>Ned looked at his two guardians. They, perhaps
curious to see if the lad really knew anything
about air-craft, nodded permission. After all,
they argued to themselves, there was no chance
for the lad to escape. Ned, forgetting his troubles
for a time in his joy at again being able to "fuss"
over an aeroplane, bent over the refractory engine.</p>

<p>"The trouble's in one of the footpedals," he
announced before long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have to climb into the seat to fix it?" asked
Luminetti.</p>

<p>"Reckon so."</p>

<p>Ned looked at his guardians. They nodded.</p>

<p>"Don't fly away," cried one of them jokingly, as
Ned seated himself, grasped the levers and placed
his foot on the pedals to test the mechanism.</p>

<p>"It would be a good joke if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Professor Luminetti, standing by the machine,
was suddenly brushed off his feet and rolled over
on the sward.</p>

<p>"Br-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!"</p>

<p>A terrific whirring, like the voice of a multitude
of locusts, filled the air.</p>

<p>Something huge and winged and powerful
flashed by the amazed deputies, and launched itself
into the air. Before they recovered their wits,
it was out of reach.</p>

<p>"It's the aeroplane! He's stolen my aeroplane!"
screamed Professor Luminetti.</p>

<p>"Hi! Come back!" yelled the deputies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>But so swiftly had the aeroplane shot into
space that Ned was already out of ear-shot.</p>

<p>Hearing the babel of excited sounds, the constable
came dashing from the tent. In the excitement,
he let go of the pickpocket's collar, and
that miscreant at once darted off.</p>

<p>"Get him! Bring him back!" shouted the arm
of the Dundertown law.</p>

<p>"What do you think we are&mdash;a couple of
birds?" demanded his deputies. "Get him yourself!"</p>

<p>The constable drew out his revolver and began
firing into the air. He might as well have fired
at the moon as at Ned. The aeroplane dwindled
swiftly to a winged blot, then to a speck, and,
finally, vanished altogether.</p>

<p>"I'll swear out a warrant for him!" shouted
the manager.</p>

<p>"Well, don't do any more swearing, then,"
warned the constable, "er I'll arrest you fer usin'
profane langwidge. I've lost two prisoners, an'
I've got ter lock up somebody."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Luckily, at that moment, a small boy was captured
as he was creeping under the canvas. In
the act of giving him a sound spanking, the irate
group left behind found some salve for their
wounded feelings. Luminetti raved and tore his
hair. The manager promised to wreak dire vengeance
on Ned as soon as he got hold of him. As
for the populace, when the story leaked out, some
of them, among these being Sam, were so unfeeling
as to laugh heartily. As for the quartermaster,
he at once set about to report the constable
to all the authorities in the United States,
from the president down.</p>

<p>In the meantime, what of Ned?</p>

<p>If any of our readers imagine that he took
the aeroplane on purpose, they are mistaken.
What seemed like a cleverly executed plan of
escape was, in reality, the result of an accident,
pure and simple, but a fortunate one, as it
proved.</p>

<p>When Ned had placed his foot on the starting
pedal, to his astonishment the bit of machinery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
refused to budge. He pressed harder, and, suddenly
something snapped. The next instant Ned
felt himself being hurtled forward over the
ground.</p>

<p>To prevent the aeroplane plunging into a tent
or wagon and being wrecked, he had resorted to
the only mode of procedure possible. He had set
the rising planes.</p>

<p>Instantly the aeroplane responded. Behind him
Ned could hear shouts and cries, and guessed
that those he had left behind were imagining he
was attempting to escape.</p>

<p>"If I land I'll have a hard job convincing them
I wasn't," said Ned to himself.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, the lad tried with all his might
to check the aeroplane's flight. But whatever
had broken rendered this impossible. Try as he
would, he could not stop the engine. His only
safety, therefore, lay in keeping aloft. As the
aeroplane rushed on through space, it gathered
speed instead of diminishing the fury of its
course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>It was all Ned could do to cling to the seat and
control the frantic buckings and plungings of his
aerial steed. The fact that though similar to the
one he used, he was unfamiliar with the particular
aeroplane in which he found himself, complicated
his difficulties.</p>

<p>"I guess the only thing to do is to keep on till
the gasolene gives out," he thought, after his
twentieth attempt to check his runaway engine.
"Reminds me of Don Quixote's ride with Sancho
Panza to the palace of the magician in cloudland,"
was the whimsical thought that occurred to him.
"Poor old Herc! It's not very complimentary to
him to compare him to Sancho, but I wish he was
here with me."</p>

<p>The fuel tank of the aeroplane must have been
well filled, for the engine ran just as strongly at
the end of an hour of aerial traveling as it had at
the beginning of the trip.</p>

<p>"I'd turn round if I dared," thought Ned; "but
I can't check the speed of the thing, and it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
be suicidal to try to switch my course while going
at this speed."</p>

<p>Ned's plight may be compared to that of a lad
on a runaway bicycle on a steep hill. He did not
dare turn for fear of disaster, and yet he didn't
quite know what would happen if he kept on.
However, he didn't have to be scared of colliding
with a wagon!</p>

<p>Suddenly, to Ned's huge joy, the engine showed
signs of slackening speed. He gently manipulated
a lever, and found that he had partial control
of the machine now. This being so, he decided
to land as soon as practicable. From a
clump of trees some distance ahead, the white
spire of a church told him of a village. To his
left hand lay the sea. Ned gazed at it longingly,
as he dropped nearer and nearer to the ground.</p>

<p>He landed at the edge of a meadow adjoining
a building which was occupied by the village post-office
and telegraph office. A sign on a house
across the way made his heart leap:</p>

<p>"Blackhaven Hotel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>Chance had actually brought him within close
range of the fleet. It seemed too good to be true.
But a crowd of villagers, who came rushing to
inspect the visitor from cloudland, soon put all
other thoughts but the safety of his machine out
of his mind. If he had not watched it carefully,
there seemed to be danger of its being ripped to
bits by souvenir hunters.</p>

<p>A brief inspection showed Ned that a broken
tension-spring had caused the runaway. It was
soon adjusted. Then he peeped into the gasolene
tank. It was almost empty.</p>

<p>"They sell gasolene in ther store there, mister,"
said a bright lad. "Gasolene gigs come through
here onct in a while."</p>

<p>"When they's lost," struck in another lad.</p>

<p>This was good news to Ned. Leaving the lads
to guard the machine, he entered the post-office.
The postmaster imperturbably sold him five gallons
of gasolene. Ned recollected that he couldn't
pay for it. But, unfortunately, this did not occur
to him till he had emptied it into the tank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly had he done so, and was starting back
to the store with explanations, when the postmaster,
who was also telegraph operator, appeared
in the doorway of his emporium. He
was waving a yellow telegram.</p>

<p>"Hold that feller, one of yer!" he shouted.
"That thar's a stolen sky-buggy, and he's no better
than a thief!"</p>

<p>A dozen men started forward to lay hands
on Ned.</p>

<p>But a sudden determination had come to the
lad. He was within striking distance of the
fleet. It was his duty to warn the officers of the
peril that menaced their vessels.</p>

<p>A rough hand seized his arm. Ned flung it off.
At the same instant his fists drove full at a big
fellow&mdash;the village blacksmith&mdash;who tried to bar
his path, swinging a heavy hammer.</p>

<p>"Stand clear!" shouted Ned, as he sprang into
the seat of his machine&mdash;or rather Professor
Luminetti's&mdash;"this machine isn't stolen&mdash;<i>it's borrowed
on Uncle Sam's service</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>The next instant the machine skyrocketed upward,
leaving behind it a trail of smoke, and sensation
that furnished talk for the village of Blackhaven
for more than a year.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MYSTERIOUS SCHOONER&mdash;CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>"Bulkley, do you see some object in the air&mdash;off
there to the northwest?"</p>

<p>Commander Dunham, of the Dreadnought
<i>Manhattan</i>, paused in his steady pacing of the
after deck, and turned to Ensign Bulkley, the
officer of the deck.</p>

<p>Ensign Bulkley brought into play the insignia
of his diurnal office, a powerful telescope, done
in brown leather, with polished, black metal trimmings.
With it, he swept the sky in the direction
indicated by his superior, for some minutes.</p>

<p>"I do see something, sir," he said presently,
"a black object, like a large bird. But it's bigger
than any bird I ever saw. By Jove, sir, it's&mdash;it's
an aeroplane!"</p>

<p>"An aeroplane! Impossible. How could one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
find its way to Blackhaven Bay? And what
could be its errand here?"</p>

<p>"I've no idea, sir. But I'll wager my commission
that it is one. Suppose you look yourself,
sir?"</p>

<p>The officer of the deck handed his telescope to
his commanding officer. Commander Dunham
gazed intently through it for a few moments.
Then he turned to Bulkley.</p>

<p>"By all that's wonderful, you're right, Mr.
Bulkley. It seems to be coming this way, too."</p>

<p>"Not a doubt of it, sir. But at the rate it is
advancing it should not be long before we are
aware of its errand."</p>

<p>"At all events, it will relieve the monotony, Bulkley.
Anchored here since yesterday and no orders
yet. However, I suppose mine practice and general
gunnery will be the program."</p>

<p>"I expect so, sir," was the response.</p>

<p>Both officers gazed over the leaden expanse of
the landlocked bay about them.</p>

<p>Five battleships, two cruisers, and three torpedo-boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
destroyers lay at anchor, in regular
files. Hard by was a "parent ship," with her flotilla
of submarines nestling alongside, like small
chickens round a motherly old hen.</p>

<p>"Desolate country hereabouts," said Commander
Dunham presently. "I shouldn't have
thought that an airman could have found his way
here."</p>

<p>"It hardly seems possible," agreed his junior;
"it's as barren a bit of coast as can be imagined."</p>

<p>The aeroplane drew closer. Its outlines were
quite apparent now. On every vessel of the fleet
excitement over its approach was now visible.
Bright bits of bunting began to "wig-wag" the
news from ship to ship. On every foredeck jackies
almost suspended the tasks in hand to watch the
oncoming of the aerial craft.</p>

<p>"What a contrast, Bulkley," observed Commander
Dunham presently. "See that old sloop
off there to seaward? She is of an almost obsolete
type, while above us is coming the herald
of a new era in peace, as well as war."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is so, sir. But that sloop, obsolete as she
may appear, is quite fast. I understand she has
been tacking about the fleet all day. I wonder
what she wants?"</p>

<p>"Some fisherman, probably. However, see that
she does not come too close. In confidence, Bulkley,
I have been warned, in common with every
other commander of the fleet, to beware of a
band of daring anarchists who, it appears,
have made no secret abroad of their intention to
damage the United States navy."</p>

<p>The navy officer showed no surprise. It is a
common enough incident for warnings of the
same character. The mail of the navy department
at Washington is always full of letters&mdash;some
of them menacing in tone&mdash;from over-zealous
apostles of "universal peace." Occasionally,
too, a spy is unearthed serving in Uncle Sam's
uniform. Such fellows are usually deported
quietly and swiftly.</p>

<p>"I shall keep an eye on that sloop, sir, in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
case," said the ensign, "but I'm afraid it will be
difficult to do so before very long."</p>

<p>"How is that, Bulkley?"</p>

<p>The ensign waved his hand seaward. A hazy
sort of atmosphere enveloped the horizon.</p>

<p>"Fog, eh?" commented the commander.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It will be all about us soon, or I'm
mistaken. But look, sir, that aeroplane is almost
above us."</p>

<p>"By George!&mdash;so it is. What's the aviator doing?
He's signalling us. He's pointing downward,
Bulkley, too."</p>

<p>"Looks as if he wanted to land on our decks,
sir."</p>

<p>"It does. Hark! What's that he's shouting?
Pshaw, I can't hear. Tell you what, Bulkley,
order the aerial landing platform rigged at once.
It ought not to take more than fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"I'll have it done at once, sir."</p>

<p>The officer hastened off on his errand. A
scene of bustle ensued. A hundred jackies were
busy transporting sections of the adjustable platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
on which Ned had landed on the occasion of
his great triumph. The scene appeared to be involved
in inextricable confusion. But each man
had his task to perform, and each pursued it industriously.
Before long the platform was up&mdash;all
but the flooring. The work of laying this on
the steel uprights and skeleton supporting structure
was soon accomplished.</p>

<p>All this time the mysterious aerial visitant had
been hovering aloft. But his task of keeping
above the battleship was getting momentarily
more and more difficult. The atmosphere was
rapidly thickening. In white wraiths and billows
the fog, which Ensign Bulkley had prophesied,
came rolling in. Beads of moisture gathered on
everything. From the deck the tops of the basket-like
military masts grew every minute more
difficult to espy. The aeroplane, circling in space,
was a mere blur.</p>

<p>"All ready, sir," announced Ensign Bulkley before
long. By this time the after-deck was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
crowded with officers. All were gazing upward
into the steamy fog.</p>

<p>"Give him a signal, Bulkley," ordered the commander.</p>

<p>"He'll find it hard to see one, sir."</p>

<p>"Signal the bridge, then, to blow three blasts on
the siren. He can hear that."</p>

<p>"Hoo-oo-o-o-o! Hoo-oo-o-o-o! Hoo-o-o-o-o!"</p>

<p>A few seconds later the uncanny voice of the
siren cut the mist. Without hesitation, the dim
object in the fog above them, began to come
downward. It swung through the thick air rapidly.
In a short time it was off the stern of the
<i>Manhattan</i>, and ten minutes after the signal had
sounded Ned Strong ran his aeroplane upon the
landing platform so speedily erected.</p>

<p>But if the manner of his arrival had been sensational,
the effect it created was even more so.</p>

<p>"It's Strong! The man we were wirelessed had
decamped with part of Lieutenant De Frees'
funds!" exclaimed Captain Dunham amazedly.</p>

<p>Ned half staggered from his seat and came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
toward him. The sailors stood to one side, in a
half-awed fashion. Ned's face, after his long and
trying strain, was ghastly. His eyes shone with
an unnatural brightness.</p>

<p>"Well, my lad," said the commander briskly,
"what is the meaning of all this?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;can I speak&mdash;&mdash;" began Ned.</p>

<p>But suddenly the decks and the eager faces
about him seemed to join in a mad dance. He
swayed weakly, and would have fallen, had not
some jackies near at hand caught him.</p>

<p>"Send that man to the sick bay," ordered Commander
Dunham. "There's something out of the
ordinary in all this," he said in a lower tone to
his officers.</p>

<p>Ned was half-carried, half-supported, to the
ship's hospital. He soon recovered from his
temporary weakness, and asked to see the doctor
at once. When that dignitary responded to the
summons, he drank in, with eager ears, Ned's
astonishing story. The result was, that Commander
Dunham was at once requested to visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the sick bay. A conference ensued, which lasted
till almost dark. By that time Ned was fully
recovered.</p>

<p>It was after dark that a torpedo-boat destroyer,
with Ensign Bulkley in command, slipped away
from the fleet and vanished in the fog. On the
conning tower, beside the officer, was Ned Strong.</p>

<p>The powerful searchlight cut a bright path
through the mist ahead. Somewhere in that
smother lay the craft they were in search of, the
anarchists' sloop, on board of which Herc was a
prisoner. How eagerly Ned longed for the fog
to lift, may be imagined. But they cruised all
night without a sign of its lifting. By daylight
they were some distance out at sea. When, at
eight o'clock, the fog began to lift, the shore was
revealed, before long, as a dim, blue streak in
the distance.</p>

<p>But nobody had eyes for that when a sudden
shout went up from the lookout forward.</p>

<p>The man had sighted a sail on the horizon. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
as they drew closer to it, the craft was seen to be
a schooner with a short, stumpy mizzen-mast.</p>

<p>"That's not our boat," said the ensign disappointedly.</p>

<p>"But what can have become of the sloop, sir?"
wondered Ned. "Surely, she couldn't have vanished
from sight during the night. She's not a
fast enough sailer for that."</p>

<p>"True," said Bulkley. "By Jove!" he exclaimed
suddenly, "you don't think those chaps have disguised
her, do you?"</p>

<p>"They might have, sir. Don't you think it's
worth while to board that schooner, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I do, Strong," agreed the officer.</p>

<p>The destroyer was headed toward the schooner.
The wind had dropped and the vessel was rolling
idly on the oily sea.</p>

<p>"Aboard the schooner there!" cried the officer,
as they came up close to the vessel with the peculiar-looking
after-mast. "Stand by! We are
going to board you."</p>

<p>A bearded man stood at the helm. He was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
only person visible. Ned scrutinized his face
eagerly, but could not recognize him. This individual
only waved a hand in response to the officer's
order. But, as the destroyer's way was
checked, and she lay idly on the waves, he suddenly
vanished into the cabin. The next instant
a square port at the schooner's bow was swung
open, and, without the slightest warning, a long,
shining, cylindrical object was shot forth.</p>

<p>It struck the water with a swirl of spray, and
then, with a line of white wake, in its swift course,
headed straight for the destroyer.</p>

<p>"A torpedo!" exclaimed the officer, who, with
Ned, was just about to clamber into one of the
lowered boats.</p>

<p>The men on board set up a horrified shout. So
short was the distance between the two craft that
between the launching of the torpedo and the
dreaded impact of its "war head" against the
side of the destroyer seemed but an instant. It
was a fearful instant, though, and lived long in
the recollection of those who endured it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>The torpedo struck the side of the destroyer
with a metallic clang. But no explosion followed.
Instead, the implement floated harmlessly off.</p>

<p>"Phew!" exclaimed the officer, wiping his forehead.
"What an escape! I thought we were all
booked for Kingdom Come. Come, lads, man the
oars quickly. We'll get those anarchistic rascals
out of their rat-holes and make them suffer for
this outrage. But what the dickens was the matter
with that torpedo?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"I think I can explain, sir," rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>"By Jove, you can? Let's hear your explanation."</p>

<p>"You see, sir," said Ned, "while Herc and I
were exploring that cabin, we found those torpedoes.
Well, when an opportunity presented itself,
I unscrewed the head of each, and withdrew
the gun-cotton. But I was afraid that, after they
marooned me, the anarchists might have examined
them and found out what I'd done and reloaded
them. But I'm confident now that they haven't."</p>

<p>"No, you've drawn their teeth with a vengeance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
I tremble to think, though, what would
have happened if they had had an opportunity to
use one of the loaded ones. They're a sharp outfit
of tricksters, too, with their disguised sloop."</p>

<p>"But not sharp enough to fool Uncle Sam," exclaimed
Ned, as the boat was run alongside.</p>

<p>As it scraped the disguised sloop's side, a figure
suddenly appeared on the deck. It was Herc.
He made a flying leap for the boat, and landed in
a heap in their midst.</p>

<p>"Row for your lives!" he yelled. "That maniac,
Muller, is about to blow up the vessel. I got away
by knocking a couple of the crew galley-west."</p>

<p>"Give way, men!" shouted the officer, and willing
arms pulled the boat from the schooner's
side. But the explosion did not come. Instead,
two figures, recognized as those of Merritt and
Chance, appeared on the deck. They signalled
for the boat to come closer.</p>

<p>"We captured Muller, just as he was about to
blow up the sloop," they shouted. "If we surrender,
will you show us clemency?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll make no promises," was the grim reply
of Ensign Bulkley.</p>

<p>Something like an hour later, the destroyer,
with the disguised sloop in tow, re-entered Blackhaven
Bay. On board her&mdash;a raving maniac&mdash;was
Herr Muller. His long-smouldering insanity
had at last broken into flame. He was
confined on board the <i>Manhattan</i> for a time and
then removed to an asylum, where he now is.
He will never recover his reason, and unceasingly
imagines that his mission is to destroy the
United States navy. As for his followers, they
received various terms in prison. Kennell, alone,
escaped. It transpired that he had been sent
ashore after supplies, and so was not on board
the disguised sloop when the futile attempt to
blow up the destroyer was made.</p>

<p>Of course, the suspicion which had been
directed against Ned and Herc was speedily
explained away, and they were rated higher than
ever in the estimation of their officers. Part of
the substantial monetary reward Ned received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
for his courage and resource in reaching the
fleet, via aeroplane, was sent to Professor Luminetti,
the King of the Air. The quartermaster at
Dundertown received a severe reprimand for his
over-zealousness, but nothing more was done to
him, as, after all, he thought he was performing
his duty.</p>

<p>Had we space, we would like to relate the further
aerial adventures of Ned and Herc on Aero
Service. But sufficient have been related here to
convey some idea of the importance of such an
adjunct to our navy. It will always be a proud
boast of the Dreadnought Boys that they helped
to establish the aeroplane as a valuable auxiliary
of the modern battleship.</p>

<p>But the scenes shift rapidly on the stage of
naval life. Fresh places and opportunities were
shortly to be presented to the Dreadnought Boys.</p>

<p>Uncle Sam's navy was on the eve of its epoch-making,
globe-circling voyage. If you care
to follow further the careers of The Dreadnought
Boys, and learn how they conducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
themselves amidst novel surroundings and
changing and exciting conditions, you will find
it all set down in the next volume of this series,
"<i>The Dreadnought Boys' World Cruise</i>."</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
